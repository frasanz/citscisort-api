Highlighting the diversity of existing models and approaches to citizen science, participants focused on six different conservation-related outcomes that citizen science projects can potentially support: policy, education, community capacity building, site management, species management; and research. We provide two example case studies of projects and summarize the key themes and recommendations associated with each of those outcomes. The result is a series of "toolkits" that can help to guide new and existing citizen science projects that aim to support management and conservation of ocean resources, as well as providing insights and recommendations to stimulate further research on and assessment of marine and coastal citizen science programs. Citizen science is an effective approach to conservation and it is time for this underutilized resource to become a more prominent approach for marine and coastal conservation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While many existing studies focus on the performance of specific citizen science examples, this paper goes beyond this approach to present a systematic global mapping of citizen science used for DRR in order to draw out broader insights across diverse methods, initiatives, hazards and country contexts. The systematic mapping analyzed a total of 106 cases of citizen science applied to DRR across all continents. Unlike many existing reviews of citizen science initiatives, relevance to the disaster risk context led us to 'open up' our mapping to a broader definition of what might constitute citizen science, including participatory research and narrative-based approaches. By taking a wider view of citizen science and opening up to other disciplinary practices as valid ways of knowing risks and hazards, we also capture these alternative examples and discuss their relevance for aiding effective decision-making around risk reduction. Based on this analysis we draw out lessons for future research and practice of citizen science for DRR including the need to: build interconnections between disparate citizen science methods and practitioners; address multi-dimensionality within and across hazard cycles; and develop principles and frameworks for evaluating citizen science initiatives that not only ensure scientific competence but also attend to questions of equity, responsibility and the empowerment of those most vulnerable to disaster risk.

However, the openness of participatory sensing exposes the system to malicious and erroneous participations, inevitably resulting in poor data quality. This brings forth the important issues of false data detection and correction in participatory sensing. Furthermore, data collected by participants normally include considerable missing values, which poses challenges for accurate false data detection. In this work, we propose DECO, a general framework to detect false values for participatory sensing in the presence of missing data. By applying a tailored spatio-temporal compressive sensing technique, DECO is able to accurately detect the false data and estimate both false and missing values for data correction. We validate our design through an experimental case study.

A significant issue which determines the success of participatory sensing is the incentive for contributors. In this paper, we propose an information-driven incentive scheme with consumer demand awareness for participatory sensing. An information utility metric is introduced to measure the quality of sensor information from contributors according to the consumer demand. The contributors with the most information utility are selected and incentivized, which allows us to maximize the satisfaction of the consumers as well as the profits of the service provider. Based on the incentive scheme, contributors and consumers determine their participation levels respectively to maximize their utilities. The performance of the proposed incentive scheme is investigated through extensive simulations, which show an improved information utility and sensing coverage.

Following their lead, we propose to use a form of public participation in scientific research known as participatory sensing to increase engagement in these academic areas. Participatory sensing involves volunteers using mobile phones and the embedded sensing capabilities to collect data, and is well suited for the task as it provides the students with a familiar tool for conducting complex scientific research. To accomplish this goal, we have developed two components: a toolkit for defining, creating, and managing a participatory sensing campaign, including automated generation of mobile applications; and a curriculum designed around the toolkit, where students conduct scientific research with mobile phones as their primary data collection tools. Thus far, the results of this work have shown the potential for participatory sensing as an informal education tool to increase engagement and interest in pursuing careers in science and technology.

More effective efforts are urgently required to improve the capacity of marine conservation action worldwide, as highlighted by the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030. Marine citizen science presents a promising avenue to enhance engagement in marine conservation around the globe. Building on an expanding field of citizen science research and practice, we present a global overview of the current extent and potential of marine citizen science and its contribution to marine conservation. Employing an online global survey, we explore the geographical distribution, type and format of 74 marine citizen science projects. By assessing how the projects adhere to the Ten Principles of Citizen Science (as defined by the European Citizen Science Association), we investigate project development, identify challenges and outline future opportunities to contribute to marine science and conservation. Synthesizing the survey results and drawing on evidence from case studies of diverse projects, we assess whether and how citizen science can lead to new scientific knowledge and enhanced environmental stewardship. Overall, we explore how marine citizen science can inform current understanding of marine biodiversity and support the development and implementation of marine conservation initiatives worldwide. This article is part of the theme issue 'Integrative research perspectives on marine conservation'.

Citizen science revolves around gathering data and using it. This means, that data storing is a vital part of any citizen science project and can affect the success or failure. Many researches focus on the citizen side, while the data side is often left out. This study aims to fill the gap by trying to find the current data storing practices in the field of citizen science. A systematic literature review was conducted and multiple similarities in data storing and management techniques were identified between different citizen science projects. Results show that most projects used a traditional relational database to store data, a separate web interface to add, use, modify, and access the data, and data validation was left to users by having them vote on existing data. Data models always considered the data provider (citizen) but left out the end user in their design. In the future, the results will be compared to ongoing citizen science project and see if it is possible to improve the efficiency and overall quality of citizen science databases.

J	Hamza, A; Jiomekong, A				Hamza, Adamou; Jiomekong, Azanzi			High Performance Computing in Resource Poor Settings: An Approach based on Volunteer Computing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Volunteer computing; resource poor settings; high performance computing; matrix multiplication		High Performance Computing (HPC) systems aim to solve complex computing problems (in a short amount of time) that are either too large for standard computers or would take too long. They are used to solve computational problems in many fields such as medical science (for drug discovery, breast cancer detection in images, etc.), climate science, physics, mathematical science, etc. Existing solutions such as HPC Supercomputer, HPC Cluster, HPC Cloud or HPC Grid are not adapted for resource poor settings (mainly for developing countries) because their fees are generally beyond the funding (particularly for academics) and the administrative complexity to access to HPC Grid creates a higher barrier. This paper presents an approach allowing to build a Volunteer Computing system for HPC in resource poor settings. This solution does not require any additional investment in hardware, but relies instead on voluntary machines already owned by the private users. The experiment has been made on the mathematical problem of solving the matrices multiplication using Volunteer Computing system. Given the success of this experiment, the enrollment of other volunteers has already started. The goal being to create a powerful Volunteer Computing system with the maximum number of computers.

J	Suman, AB; Alblas, E				Suman, Anna Berti; Alblas, Edwin			Exploring Citizen Science over Time: Sensing, Technology and the Law	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						citizen science; sensing; history; environmental law; environmental rights; (dis)trust	LIFE	People over the course of history have survived by developing their ability to 'sense' their environment as an embryonic form of citizen science. With the emergence of modern states, governments have assumed responsibility for monitoring the quality of the environment, and progressively the practice and role of citizen science has changed. This review explores the different manifestations of citizen science over time, with a focus on its law and governance dimensions, reading this evolution as a critical analysis of the current discourses around citizen science. The evolution of citizen science throughout history and its transformation shows certain patterns that are highlighted in this article as 'constant' features, whereas other features are instead interrupted and reversed, and new ones emerge. We thus examined citizen science over time by asking what is really new about this phenomenon, focusing on constants-permanent features-and turning points-changes in direction. We argue that these dynamics are central to understanding the promises and perils of the practice, to fully grasping the forms of uninvited, reactive environmental citizen science and to scoping foreseeable future scenarios.

J	McAteer, B; Flannery, W; Murtagh, B				McAteer, Benedict; Flannery, Wesley; Murtagh, Brendan			Linking the motivations and outcomes of volunteers to understand participation in marine community science	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Citizen science; Marine conservation; Participation; Volunteerism; Knowledge; Learning; Community	CITIZEN-SCIENCE; IMPROVE CONSERVATION; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK	To achieve sustained participation, community science projects aim to satisfy the motivations and desired personal outcomes of their volunteers. Evaluating participation is, therefore, crucial, with projects seeking to assess volunteers' motivations for engagement and the complex outcomes that they achieve through their participation. Many assessments have, however, ineffectively examined the relationship between volunteers' motivations and how they relate to the personal outcomes that they wish to pursue. Evaluations of the personal outcomes achieved by volunteers often fail to consider whether these outcomes were desired or if they aligned with volunteers' motivations, and tend to narrowly focus on general outcomes, such as developing scientific or environmental literacy. Failing to link motivations and outcomes can mean that participation becomes unfulfilling for volunteers, as their desires may not be achieved, lessening the likelihood of sustained engagement. If the satisfaction of volunteers is to be accurately understood, assessing the full scope of their motivations in conjunction with their desired outcomes is crucial. We address this research gap by conducting a survey (n = 308) with the participants of 8 marine community science projects in Ireland and the UK, critically assessing volunteers' roles, motivations, outcomes and experiences of participation through an exploratory factor analysis. We find a range of patterns amongst respondents and identify 4 types of volunteer profiles: Activists, Conservationists, Professionals and Hobbyists. We discuss how categorising volunteers in this manner can better reflect the motivations and desires of volunteers and highlight the factors that support or inhibit the realisation of these intentions within specific projects. We conclude by suggesting that projects seeking to better understand participation should broaden their evaluative scope to embrace a wider range of volunteer motivational pathways, discussing how this can improve both a project's management of volunteers and its capacity to realise both project and volunteer outcomes.

One of the major challenges in participatory sensing is the privacy issue. Sensing data from smartphones may contain sensitive information such as user locations. Thus, it is of great importance to preserve privacy throughout the data collection process in participatory sensing. It is however very challenging because of the distributed nature of the network, many potential malicious attackers and the convergecast model of data collection. In this paper, we present a data collection approach which preserves user privacy in participatory sensing. In this approach, a smartphone node utilizes other smartphones as intermediate nodes to transfer its sensing data. In addition, asymmetric encryption is used to prevent malicious reverse tracking along the data forwarding route, hence anonymizing the originator of the data. We analyze the security of the approach and show that it achieves a high level of security. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach has a low overhead.

Thus the connection between citizen science and schools offers an interesting approach to explore. However, a lot of questions and challenges remain unclear, such as the balance between scientific and educational goals. In this research, we explore how citizen science initiatives have been implemented in formal education contexts through a systematic literature review. The final aim is to identify relevant characteristics, define profiles of initiatives and offer future implications. Through the PRISMA Protocol, we have selected 46 published citizen science initiatives to analyse. Our findings show four different profiles of citizen science initiatives in schools: Students using science, Students helping science, Students learning science collecting data and Students learning science by acting as scientists. From the discussion of these profiles, we suggest some considerations for researchers and designers.

However, little research has focused on understanding this emerging field and its implications for PHEP. To address research gaps, this paper: (1) assesses the state of disaster citizen science by developing an inventory of disaster citizen science projects; (2) identifies different models of disaster citizen science; and (3) assesses their relevance for PHEP.MethodsWe searched the English-language peer-reviewed and grey literature for disaster citizen science projects with no time period specified. Following searches, a team of three reviewers applied inclusion/exclusion criteria that defined eligible disasters and citizen science activities. Reviewers extracted the following elements from each project: project name and description; lead and partner entities; geographic setting; start and end dates; type of disaster; disaster phase; citizen science model; and technologies used.ResultsA final set of 209 projects, covering the time period 1953-2017, were included in the inventory. Projects were classified across five citizen science models: distributed or volunteer sensing (n =19; 9%); contributory (n =98; 47%); distributed intelligence (n =52; 25%); collaborative research (n =32; 15%); and collegial research (n =8; 4%). Overall, projects were conducted across all disaster phases and most frequently for earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. Although activities occurred globally, 40% of projects were set in the U.S. Academic, government, technology, and advocacy organizations were the most prevalent lead entities. Although a range of technologies were used, 77% of projects (n =161) required an internet-connected device. These characteristics varied across citizen science models revealing important implications for applications of disaster citizen science, enhancement of disaster response capabilities, and sustainability of activities over time.ConclusionsBy increasing engagement in research, disaster citizen science may empower communities to take collective action, improve system response capabilities, and generate relevant data to mitigate adverse health impacts. The project inventory established a baseline for future research to capitalize on opportunities, address limitations, and help disaster citizen science achieve its potential.

A Science Products Inventory for Citizen-Science Planning and Evaluation	BIOSCIENCE			English	Article						citizen science; evaluation; science products inventory; altmetrics; science policy	TOOL	Citizen science involves a range of practices involving public participation in scientific knowledge production, but outcomes evaluation is complicated by the diversity of the goals and forms of citizen science. Publications and citations are not adequate metrics to describe citizen-science productivity. We address this gap by contributing a science products inventory (SPI) tool, iteratively developed through an expert panel and case studies, intended to support general-purpose planning and evaluation of citizen-science projects with respect to science productivity. The SPI includes a collection of items for tracking the production of science outputs and data practices, which are described and illustrated with examples. Several opportunities for further development of the initial inventory are highlighted, as well as potential for using the inventory as a tool to guide project management, funding, and research on citizen science.

J	Ciasullo, MV; Carli, M; Lim, WM; Palumbo, R				Ciasullo, Maria Vincenza; Carli, Mariarosaria; Lim, Weng Marc; Palumbo, Rocco			An open innovation approach to co-produce scientific knowledge: an examination of citizen science in the healthcare ecosystem	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Citizen science; People engagement; Research; Innovation; Co-creation	TRANSFORMATION; ENGAGEMENT; EDUCATION; BENEFITS; DESIGN; ISSUES	Purpose The article applies the citizen science phenomenon - i.e. lay people involvement in research endeavours aimed at pushing forward scientific knowledge - to healthcare. Attention is paid to initiatives intended to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic as an illustrative case to exemplify the contribution of citizen science to system-wide innovation in healthcare. Design/methodology/approach A mixed methodology consisting of three sequential steps was developed. Firstly, a realist literature review was carried out to contextualize citizen science to healthcare. Then, an account of successfully completed large-scale, online citizen science projects dealing with healthcare and medicine has been conducted in order to obtain preliminary information about distinguishing features of citizen science in healthcare. Thirdly, a broad search of citizen science initiatives targeted to tackling the COVID-19 pandemic has been performed. A comparative case study approach has been undertaken to examine the attributes of such projects and to unravel their peculiarities. Findings Citizen science enacts the development of a lively healthcare ecosystem, which takes its nourishment from the voluntary contribution of lay people. Citizen scientists play different roles in accomplishing citizen science initiatives, ranging from data collectors to data analysts. Alongside enabling big data management, citizen science contributes to lay people's education and empowerment, soliciting their active involvement in service co-production and value co-creation. Practical implications Citizen science is still underexplored in healthcare. Even though further evidence is needed to emphasize the value of lay people's involvement in scientific research applied to healthcare, citizen science is expected to revolutionize the way innovation is pursued and achieved in the healthcare ecosystem. Engaging lay people in a co-creating partnership with expert scientist can help us to address unprecedented health-related challenges and to shape the future of healthcare. Tailored health policy and management interventions are required to empower lay people and to stimulate their active engagement in value co-creation. Originality/value Citizen science relies on the wisdom of the crowd to address major issues faced by healthcare organizations. The article comes up with a state of the art investigation of citizen science in healthcare, shedding light on its attributes and envisioning avenues for further development.

Reliable, timely, comprehensive, and consistent data are critical for measuring progress towards, and ultimately achieving, the SDGs. Data from citizen science represent one new source of data that could be used for SDG reporting and monitoring. However, information is still lacking regarding the current and potential contributions of citizen science to the SDG indicator framework. Through a systematic review of the metadata and work plans of the 244 SDG indicators, as well as the identification of past and ongoing citizen science initiatives that could directly or indirectly provide data for these indicators, this paper presents an overview of where citizen science is already contributing and could contribute data to the SDG indicator framework. The results demonstrate that citizen science is "already contributing" to the monitoring of 5 SDG indicators, and that citizen science "could contribute" to 76 indicators, which, together, equates to around 33%. Our analysis also shows that the greatest inputs from citizen science to the SDG framework relate to SDG 15 Life on Land, SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 3 Good Health and Wellbeing, and SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation. Realizing the full potential of citizen science requires demonstrating its value in the global data ecosystem, building partnerships around citizen science data to accelerate SDG progress, and leveraging investments to enhance its use and impact.

Can citizen science contribute to the evidence-base that underpins marine policy?	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Citizen science; Marine policy; Marine evidence	COASTAL MANAGEMENT; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; COMMUNITY; REEF; PARTICIPATION; VOLUNTEER; TECHNOLOGIES; BIODIVERSITY; INVOLVEMENT; FISHERIES	Marine legislation is becoming ever more complex, so new cost-effective ways of obtaining and processing increasingly large data sets are required to support evidence-based policy making. Citizen science is one solution, but the uptake of the evidence generated by citizens among policy makers is often limited. Here, the importance of citizen science in delivery of the evidence-base that underpins marine policy was assessed using a series of case-studies. There was no consistent rationale for developing policy-relevant citizen science, but drivers included: lack of existing data, difficulty in collecting data by other means, the use of citizen science data by other organisations, and the capabilities of volunteers. Challenges to the uptake of marine citizen science were identified from policy-maker, scientist and citizen perspectives, and these related to data quality, data access, motivation of volunteers, and physical location. Citizen science has good potential to contribute to the evidence-base alongside traditional monitoring, remote sensing, and modelling, but only if outputs from citizen science projects are judged individually on quality. If this is the case, citizen science has an important role in delivery and understanding of future marine policy, but is only one part of an integrated solution.

This paper situates the origins and rise of the term "citizen science" and offers a new framework to better understand the diversity of epistemic practices involved in these participatory projects. It contextualizes "citizen science" within the broader history of public participation in science and analyzes critically the current promises-democratization, education, discoveries-emerging within the "citizen science" discourse. Finally, it maps a number of historical, political, and social questions for future research in the critical studies of "citizen science."

J	Dunkley, RA				Dunkley, Ria Ann			Monitoring ecological change in UK woodlands and rivers: Anexploration of the relational geographies of citizen science	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						affect; citizen science; emotional spatiality; relational geographies; river monitoring; woodland phenology	EMOTIONS; CONSERVATION; VOLUNTEERS	The adoption of citizen science methodologies by environmental organisations and ecologists entrusts the task of collecting ecological data to non-experts operating at a local scale. This presents individuals and communities with opportunities to monitor ecological change and contribute to local environmental management. Little is known about why volunteers choose to participate in burgeoning contemporary citizen science research initiatives. The aim of this paper is thus to explore volunteer motivation for involvement in two environmental citizen science initiatives, based in the United Kingdom. It contributes to understandings of the socio-geographical influences that act on participation in environmental citizen science. It is proposed within this paper that affective connections with local geographies provide a conceptual framework for understanding citizen science motivations. The paper discusses the main themes emerging from site-based, in-depth interviews with 22 citizen science participants in various UK locations. The study revealed that early affective bonds formed with ecological spaces endured throughout life courses, while citizen science participation offered a way of remaining connected to local environments. The paper reflects on the endurance of affective environmental bonds and their manifestation within the expressed motivations for citizen science participation, which emerged as fulfilling a compulsion to observe ecological surroundings, a desire to participate in environmental research and a commitment to protecting local environments. The paper proposes that citizen science participation offers a framework to connect to and protect local and global affinity spaces, while assisting in monitoring global environmental change.

This expansion is accompanied by the formation of associations and networks dedicated to citizen science practitioners, which aim at supporting citizen science as a research approach. This chapter examines how four such organizations in the United States, Europe, Australia, and China have begun to take shape, and are working with citizen science communities and stakeholders in respective regions and globally. Challenges and future plans of these groups are also discussed. This chapter identifies three core roles of citizen science practitioner organization: 1) establishing communities of practitioners, 2) building expertise through sharing of existing and developing new knowledge, and 3) representing community interests.

O.			Citizen science platforms can effectively support early detection of invasive alien species according to species traits	PEOPLE AND NATURE			English	Article; Early Access						biosecurity; citizen science; early detection; early warning; non-native species traits; participation; surveillance	ENGAGE	Early detection and rapid response are essential to deal effectively with new introductions of invasive alien species (IAS). Citizen science platforms for opportunistic recording of species are increasingly popular, and there is potential to harvest their data for early detection of IAS, but this has not been tested. We evaluated the potential of data from existing citizen science platforms for early detection of IAS by obtaining 687 first records of species from 30 European countries where there was both an official first record (i.e. published in scientific literature or by a government agency) and a record in a citizen science platform. We tested how the difference between the two (time lag) was related to species traits, popularity in citizen science platforms, public and research attention and regulatory status. We found that for 50% of the time lag records, citizen science platforms reported IAS earlier than or in the same year as the official databases. Although we cannot determine causality (the first official record could have been from a citizen science platform, or contemporaneous with it), this demonstrates that citizen science platforms are effective for IAS early detection. Time lags were largely affected by species traits. Compared with official records, vertebrates were more likely to have earlier records on citizen science platforms, than plants or invertebrates. Greater popularity of the IAS in citizen science platforms and its observation in neighbouring countries resulted in earlier citizen science reporting. In contrast, inclusion in the EU priority list resulted in earlier official recording, reflecting the efficacy of targeted surveillance programmes. However, time lags were not affected by the overall activity of citizen platforms per country. Synthesis and applications. Multi-species citizen science platforms for reporting nature sightings are a valuable source of information on early detection of IAS even though they are not specifically designed for this purpose. We recommend that IAS surveillance programmes should be better connected with citizen science platforms, including greater acknowledgement of the role of citizen scientists and better data flow from smaller citizen science initiatives into global databases, to support efficient early detection.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

It is assumed that citizen science could potentially contribute to an increase in environmental awareness and to advancing knowledge about environmental change and sustainability issues. In this article, we present a review of 127 citizen science projects listed on the German platform, "Burger schaffen Wissen", with the aim of analysing whether the main focus of most projects is on the scientific results or on educational aspects and how citizen science projects are connected to the SDGs. The results show that many citizen science projects overlap with SDG 4Quality Education. Of these projects, a larger proportion entail higher levels of involvement than those projects with a stronger focus on the scientific results, in which the participation of the citizen scientists is mainly standardised and at low levels. An even greater number of projects in the sample are linked to SDG 15Life on Landand, thereby, are in line with the traditional focus of citizen science. Additionally, the analysis reveals that forms of education used in citizen science projects are much more diverse than those included in SDG 4.

Disaster citizen science applications with public health relevance are growing in academic and community sectors, but integration with public health emergency preparedness, response, and recovery (PHEPRR) agencies is limited. Objective:We examined how local health departments (LHDs) and community-based organizations have used citizen science to build public health preparedness and response (PHEP) capabilities. The purpose of this study is to help LHDs make use of citizen science to support PHEPRR. Design:We conducted semistructured telephone interviews (n = 55) with LHD, academic, and community representatives engaged or interested in citizen science. We used inductive and deductive methods to code and analyze interview transcripts. Setting:US and international community-based organizations and US LHDs. Participants:Participants included 18 LHD representatives reflecting diversity in geographic regions and population sizes served and 31 disaster citizen science project leaders and 6 citizen science thought leaders. Main Outcomes:We identified challenges LHDs and academic and community partners face in using citizen science for PHEPRR as well as strategies to facilitate implementation. Results:Academic and community-led disaster citizen science activities aligned with many PHEP capabilities including community preparedness, community recovery, public health surveillance and epidemiological investigation, and volunteer management. All participant groups discussed challenges related to resources, volunteer management, collaborations, research quality, and institutional acceptance of citizen science. The LHD representatives noted unique barriers due to legal and regulatory constraints and their role in using citizen science data to inform public health decisions. Strategies to increase institutional acceptance included enhancing policy support for citizen science, increasing volunteer management support, developing best practices for research quality, strengthening collaborations, and adopting lessons learned from relevant PHEPRR activities. Conclusions:There are challenges to overcome in building PHEPRR capacity for disaster citizen science but also opportunities for LHDs to leverage the growing body of work, knowledge, and resources in academic and community sectors.

Large-bodied birds are over-represented in unstructured citizen science data	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; SPECIES TRAITS; DATA QUALITY; DETECTABILITY; BIAS; VALIDATION; PROGRAM	Citizen science platforms are quickly accumulating hundreds of millions of biodiversity observations around the world annually. Quantifying and correcting for the biases in citizen science datasets remains an important first step before these data are used to address ecological questions and monitor biodiversity. One source of potential bias among datasets is the difference between those citizen science programs that have unstructured protocols and those that have semi-structured or structured protocols for submitting observations. To quantify biases in an unstructured citizen science platform, we contrasted bird observations from the unstructured iNaturalist platform with that from a semi-structured citizen science platform-eBird-for the continental United States. We tested whether four traits of species (body size, commonness, flock size, and color) predicted if a species was under- or over-represented in the unstructured dataset compared with the semi-structured dataset. We found strong evidence that large-bodied birds were over-represented in the unstructured citizen science dataset; moderate evidence that common species were over-represented in the unstructured dataset; strong evidence that species in large groups were over-represented; and no evidence that colorful species were over-represented in unstructured citizen science data. Our results suggest that biases exist in unstructured citizen science data when compared with semi-structured data, likely as a result of the detectability of a species and the inherent recording process. Importantly, in programs like iNaturalist the detectability process is two-fold-first, an individual organism needs to be detected, and second, it needs to be photographed, which is likely easier for many large-bodied species. Our results indicate that caution is warranted when using unstructured citizen science data in ecological modelling, and highlight body size as a fundamental trait that can be used as a covariate for modelling opportunistic species occurrence records, representing the detectability or identifiability in unstructured citizen science datasets. Future research in this space should continue to focus on quantifying and documenting biases in citizen science data, and expand our research by including structured citizen science data to understand how biases differ among unstructured, semi-structured, and structured citizen science platforms.

However, in active participatory sensing, which asks users to input text or upload photos, respondents often try to complete the request quickly and effortlessly, and consequently, not always accurately. In this study, we propose a method of expressing intention to contribute (EIC) for suppressing careless responses in participatory sensing tasks. We implemented a prototype system that requests two types of EIC method (tap the button, shake the phone), and conducted the experiment over two weeks with 20 participants. Through the statistical tests, we found that proposed EIC methods significantly suppressed the number of careless responses compared with the normal situation.

The adoption of these increasingly capable devices by society has enabled a potentially pervasive sensing paradigm - participatory sensing. A coordinated participatory sensing system engages individuals carrying mobile phones to explore phenomena of interest using in situ data collection. For participatory sensing to succeed, several technical challenges need to be solved. In this paper, we discuss one particular issue: developing a recruitment framework to enable organizers to identify well-suited participants for data collections based on geographic and temporal availability as well as participation habits. This recruitment system is evaluated through a series of pilot data collections where volunteers explored sustainable processes on a university campus.

How Do Young Community and Citizen Science Volunteers Support Scientific Research on Biodiversity? The Case of iNaturalist	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						data quality; community science; citizen science; iNaturalist; online participation; young volunteers; biodiversity	DATA QUALITY; CONSERVATION	Online community and citizen science (CCS) projects have broadened access to scientific research and enabled different forms of participation in biodiversity research; however, little is known about whether and how such opportunities are taken up by young people (aged 5-19). Furthermore, when they do participate, there is little research on whether their online activity makes a tangible contribution to scientific research. We addressed these knowledge gaps using quantitative analytical approaches and visualisations to investigate 249 youths' contributions to CCS on the iNaturalist platform, and the potential for the scientific use of their contributions. We found that nearly all the young volunteers' observations were 'verifiable' (included a photo, location, and date/time) and therefore potentially useful to biodiversity research. Furthermore, more than half were designated as 'Research Grade', with a community agreed-upon identification, making them more valuable and accessible to biodiversity science researchers. Our findings show that young volunteers with lasting participation on the platform and those aged 16-19 years are more likely to have a higher proportion of Research Grade observations than younger, or more ephemeral participants. This study enhances our understanding of young volunteers' contributions to biodiversity research, as well as the important role professional scientists and data users can play in helping verify youths' contributions to make them more accessible for biodiversity research.

We used data derived from three coccinellid-focused citizen-science programs to examine the costs and benefits of data collection from direct citizen-science (data used without verification) and verified citizen-science (observations verified by trained experts) programs. Data collated through direct citizen science overestimated species richness and diversity values in comparison to verified data, thereby influencing interpretation. The use of citizen scientists to collect data also influenced research costs; our analysis shows that verified citizen science was more cost effective than traditional science (in terms of data gathered per dollar). The ability to collect a greater number of samples through direct citizen science may compensate for reduced accuracy, depending on the type of data collected and the type(s) and extent of errors committed by volunteers.

This meeting point creates opportunities for potential benefits to both sides. Scientists may advance their research and obtain prestigious funding while non-scientists stand to gain enjoyment, new skills, and knowledge. To learn more how these inspiring outcomes can be promoted, we conceptualize citizen science and its myriad stakeholders as an ecology. We complement this metaphor with the term mutualism to express our desire for interactions in which all parties benefit from their involvement and propose a Mutualistic Ecology of Citizen Science (MECS) as an analytic framework that can potentially contribute to the design and conceptualization of learning in citizen science projects. In this chapter, we operationalize this framework, using four lenses that span several disciplines to look at potential benefits to different participants.

The successes of such projects have encouraged the development of customisable platforms to enable anyone to run their own citizen science project. However, the process of designing and building a citizen science project remains complex, with projects requiring both human computation and social aspects to sustain user motivation and achieve project goals. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey of 48 citizen science projects to identify common features and functionality. Supported by online community literature, we use structured walk-throughs to identify different mechanisms used to encourage volunteer contributions across four dimensions: task visibility, goals, feedback, and rewards. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on citizen science design and the relationship between community and microtask design for achieving successful outcomes.

One reason is that public health policy is produced in a complex process resulting in policies that may appear not to link up to citizen perspectives. We therefore address the central question as to whether citizen engagement in knowledge production could enable inclusive health policy making. Building on non-health work fields, we describe different types of citizen engagement in scientific research, or 'Citizen Science'. We describe the challenges that Citizen Science poses for public health, and how these could be addressed. Despite these challenges, we expect that Citizen Science or similar approaches such as participatory action research and 'popular epidemiology' may yield better knowledge, empowered communities, and improved community health. We provide a draft framework to enable evaluation of Citizen Science in practice, consisting of a descriptive typology of different kinds of Citizen Science and a causal framework that shows how Citizen Science in public health might benefit both the knowledge produced as well as the 'Citizen Scientists' as active participants.

Data generated by citizen science groups have become an increasingly important source for scientists, applied users and those pursuing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Citizen science data are used extensively in studies of biodiversity and pollution; crowdsourced data are being used by UN operational agencies for humanitarian activities; and citizen scientists are providing data relevant to monitoring the sustainable development goals (SDGs). This article provides an International Science Council (ISC) perspective on citizen science data generating activities in support of the 2030 Agenda and on needed improvements to the citizen science community's data stewardship practices for the benefit of science and society by presenting results of research undertaken by an ISC-sponsored Task Group.

Citizen Science: An Information Quality Research Frontier	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						Citizen science; Information quality; Data quality; Crowdsourcing; Science; Humanities; Information systems	COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE; GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION; CROWDSOURCING SYSTEMS; DESIGN SCIENCE; AT-HOME; WEB 2.0; FRAMEWORK; KNOWLEDGE; SUCCESS; FUTURE	The rapid proliferation of online content producing and sharing technologies resulted in an explosion of user-generated content (UGC), which now extends to scientific data. Citizen science, in which ordinary people contribute information for scientific research, epitomizes UGC. Citizen science projects are typically open to everyone, engage diverse audiences, and challenge ordinary people to produce data of highest quality to be usable in science. This also makes citizen science a very exciting area to study both traditional and innovative approaches to information quality management. With this paper we position citizen science as a leading information quality research frontier. We also show how citizen science opens a unique opportunity for the information systems community to contribute to a broad range of disciplines in natural and social sciences and humanities.

The role of citizen science in addressing grand challenges in food and agriculture research	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						citizen science; agriculture; grand challenges; sustainable development goals; extension; food science	NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; STRATEGIES; POLICY	The power of citizen science to contribute to both science and society is gaining increased recognition, particularly in physics and biology. Although there is a long history of public engagement in agriculture and food science, the term 'citizen science' has rarely been applied to these efforts. Similarly, in the emerging field of citizen science, most new citizen science projects do not focus on food or agriculture. Here, we convened thought leaders from a broad range of fields related to citizen science, agriculture, and food science to highlight key opportunities for bridging these overlapping yet disconnected communities/fields and identify ways to leverage their respective strengths. Specifically, we show that (i) citizen science projects are addressing many grand challenges facing our food systems, as outlined by the United States National Institute of Food and Agriculture, as well as broader Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations Development Programme, (ii) there exist emerging opportunities and unique challenges for citizen science in agriculture/food research, and (iii) the greatest opportunities for the development of citizen science projects in agriculture and food science will be gained by using the existing infrastructure and tools of Extension programmes and through the engagement of urban communities. Further, we argue there is no better time to foster greater collaboration between these fields given the trend of shrinking Extension programmes, the increasing need to apply innovative solutions to address rising demands on agricultural systems, and the exponential growth of the field of citizen science.

We first re-expound five essential research questions in the perspective of economics and elaborate how to study crowd science in the framework of economics in each essential question. Then, we build a simple model to illustrate the importance of wisdom of crowd by investigating the incentive of product development in crowdfunding when the market demand is uncertain. We show that, that under certain conditions, crowdfunding can provide more accurate demand information and therefore can generate better incentives to entrepreneurs and help entrepreneurs make correct decisions.

Using Citizen Science to Document Biodiversity on a University Campus: A Year-Long Case Study	CONSERVATION			English	Article						citizen science; biodiversity; iNaturalist		Citizen science is a rapidly growing field, particularly among young scientists. In this case study, we review a year-long citizen science initiative hosted at Western University, Canada, which aimed to document and highlight biodiversity on campus while simultaneously seeking to improve community engagement with the environment. Using the popular citizen science platform iNaturalist, we facilitated data collection and community engagement through a combination of informal field surveys, undergraduate-level course assignments, social media, and passive data submission. Throughout the first year of the initiative, nearly 300 community members submitted 3716 observations of 1225 species, including observations of 103 species documented on iNaturalist for the first time in the region, and other species of ecological significance. This citizen science project underscores the strengths and utility of citizen science and provides a framework for other higher education institutions to develop similar initiatives.

ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						citizen science; inequality; public engagement with science; trust		Is public engagement with science an effective response to threats against science? One form of public engagement-citizen science-might be especially useful for addressing issues of inequality that threaten public support for science. Citizen science is both public participation in the scientific process and public participation in the governance of science. In principle, citizen science empowers marginalized communities to participate in the scientific process, using the authority of science to challenge government, industry, or other institutions that exploit imbalances of social power. In practice, however, citizen science can also be used to redirect attention away from actions that address inequalities and to reinforce modes of knowledge production that exclude alternative ways of knowing relevant to those without social power. Thus, rhetoric about citizen science as a solution to threats against science needs to be tempered with attention to specific contexts and opportunities.

HUMAN ECOLOGY REVIEW			English	Article						attitudes; behaviors; citizen science; conservation; public participation	PARTICIPATION; VOLUNTEERS; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION	Citizen science the partnering of scientists with members of the public to do research is increasingly utilized in environmental research, having been credited with enabling studies that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive while promoting scientific literacy and empowering and engaging participants in conservation. Although the value of citizen-generated data for scientific purposes is increasingly accepted, and there is a growing recognition of the role of citizen science in developing science literacy, there has been little investigation of its link to conservation outcomes particularly in terms of volunteers' further engagement in conservation. This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between participation in citizen science and conservation attitude and behavior changes, and looks at the relevance of theoretical models to shed light on possible drivers of such changes. We discuss two citizen science projects in the New York metropolitan area the Great Pollinator Project and the Earthwatch Coyote Project as illustrations of the impact of citizen science on attitudes and behaviors as perceived by participants. We offer recommendations for further research on facilitating conservation outcomes through citizen science.

In this system, participatory sensing is leveraged to collect real-time sightseeing contents or data. The amount and quality of data collected in participatory sensing depend on the user's contribution. Therefore, gamification is generally utilized as an incentive mechanism. Few existing studies addressed the appropriateness of the gamification design or target tourists. In this paper, we design a gamification mechanism consisting of two types of sensing tasks and three types of rewarding methods and implement the mechanism in our participatory sensing platform called ParmoSense. We conducted a sightseeing experiment supposing three different user types. As a result, we confirmed that some type of tourists (participants) can collect sightseeing information while enjoying sightseeing through behavior change.

A questionnaire was administered, and data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).FindingsMore than 90% of responses indicated that to support citizen science activities, it is important for academic librarians to acquire information literacy, data literacy and an understanding of open science. The study found that citizen science activities require a dedicated team and continuous capacity development of team members. Findings also indicated that though academic librarians do not have knowledge of citizen science, they are willing to embrace and embed it in their services and products. Capacity shortage was listed as a challenge for academic librarians to promote and support citizen science activities.Originality/valueThis study is unique as it reports on the possible involvement of academic librarians in the field of citizen science. The link between academic librarians and the field of citizen science which is predominant in the natural sciences has a positive contribution to the body of scholarship as it promotes interdisciplinarity.

The potential of citizen science for science education has already been highlighted in various fields and by various stakeholders. More and more studies underpin this potential by providing evidence for the learning outcomes achieved through participation in citizen science projects. In formal education settings, teachers are the gatekeepers for teaching innovations and, hence, the ones who decide whether to engage students in citizen science. However, the expertise of teachers who have already participated in citizen science with their students has not been studied on a broad international level. Therefore, to investigate their experience and learn from their expertise, this study employed a concurrent triangulation design and invited teachers to participate in a survey (N = 56) and an interview (N = 11), independent of their country of residence, their school type, and their teaching subject. The results provide insights into teachers' motivation, the engagement techniques and types of activities they used, the challenges they faced, and their recommendations for implementing citizen science in formal education settings. The present findings have important implications for the design of professional development programmes and support networks for teachers in citizen science.

Many citizen science projects exist to strengthen the management of forest pest and pathogen invasions within both pre- and post-border scenarios. Besides the value of citizen science initiatives for early detection and monitoring, they also contribute widely to raising awareness, informing decisions about eradication and containment efforts to minimize pest and pathogen spread, and even finding resistant plant material for restoration of landscapes degraded by disease. Overall, many projects actively engage citizens in the different stages of forest pest and pathogen invasions, but it is unclear how they work together across all stages of the entire biological invasion process to enhance biosecurity. Here we provide examples of citizen science projects for each stage of the biological invasion process, discuss options for developing a citizen science program to enhance biosecurity, and suggest approaches for integrating citizen science into biosecurity measures to help safeguard forest resources in the future.

However, in many citizen science projects, impact evaluation is still overly simplistic. This is particularly the case when assessing the impact of participation in citizen science on the environmental attitudes, behaviour and knowledge of citizen scientists. In an attempt to bridge the gap between the state of the art in relevant scientific fields and citizen science, this systematic literature review identified best practices and approaches in the field of environmental psychology for measuring environmental attitudes, behaviour and knowledge. From the literature, five relevant and validated approaches were identified that can be used to measure changes in attitudes, behaviour and knowledge in citizen science projects. This would allow for improved understanding of the impacts of citizen science, as well as for improved project evaluation as a whole.

Citizen science addresses two central elements of the social good model-environmental justice and inclusion with particular attention to diversity in age, gender, race/ethnicity, and social class in addressing environmental injustice that is more prevalent in underrepresented communities. This article evaluates how participation in citizen science projects focused on the environment (eco-citizen science) benefits the child's development, contributes to science, and leads to commitment to environmental stewardship and justice as adults. Our work offers a novel contribution to the discourse on social good and social justice through explicitly calling for children to be included in environmental citizen science projects. We examine the benefits and challenges of involving children in scientific projects and discuss implications for policy, practice, and future research.

Citizen science approaches have their own challenges, which need to be considered in order to achieve this aim and contribute to wider and deeper public engagement. However, programme evaluations, which discuss lessons learned in engaging the public and other stakeholders with science are rare. To address this gap, we present the H2020-funded DITOs project and discuss the use of logic models in citizen science. We share the project's assumptions, design considerations for deeper engagement and its impact pathways demonstrating how logic models can be utilised in citizen science to monitor programme effectiveness and for their successful implementation. We hope that this work will inspire citizen science practitioners to use similar tools and by doing so, share their experiences and potential barriers. This knowledge is essential for improving the way citizen science is currently practiced and its impacts to both science and society.

In this article, we discuss our perspectives on CCS associated with the Elwha River dam removals. We summarize how the public has been or could be involved in monitoring and distill lessons learned for other large dam removal projects. Much of the Elwha monitoring involved technical field work requiring training and incurring potential liability risks, guiding projects towards smaller-scale public involvement. Partnering with organizations that have capacity for volunteer management expanded CCS opportunities and provided logistical support to project managers committed to public engagement. We found that many projects engaged with students and/or with paid or unpaid interns; compensating participants in various ways can help to create reciprocal relationships that support long-term monitoring. In the future, other large dam removals could consider planning ahead for community involvement in dam removal monitoring to accommodate the technical and potentially hazardous nature of the work - broadening who may be able to participate. In addition, involving community members in setting research agendas could be an important first step in engaging them in long-term monitoring, in turn facilitating multi-generational research at the timescale of landscape-level changes. Finally, explicit relationship-building with Indigenous communities can enhance the benefits of community engagement in dam removal science for all involved.	[Eitzel, M.

Volunteer macroinvertebrate monitoring: Tensions among group goals, data quality, and outcomes	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						volunteer monitoring; citizen science; macroinvertebrate monitoring; collaborative conservation; data quality; resource mobilization theory	RESOURCE MOBILIZATION	Volunteer monitoring of natural resources is promoted for its ability to increase public awareness, to provide valuable knowledge, and to encourage policy change that promotes ecosystem health. We used the case of volunteer macroinvertebrate monitoring (VMM) in streams to investigate whether the quality of data collected is correlated with data use and organizers' perception of whether they have achieved these outcomes. We examined the relation between site and group characteristics, data quality, data use, and perceived outcomes (education, social capital, and policy change). We found that group size and the degree to which citizen groups perform tasks on their own (rather than aided by professionals) positively correlated with the quality of data collected. Group size and number of years monitoring positively influenced whether a group used their data. While one might expect that groups committed to collecting good-quality data would be more likely to use it, there was no relation between data quality and data use, and no relation between data quality and perceived outcomes. More data use was, however, correlated with a group's feeling of connection to a network of engaged citizens and professionals. While VMM may hold promise for bringing citizens and scientists together to work on joint conservation agendas, our data illustrate that data quality does not correlate with a volunteer group's desire to use their data to promote regulatory change. Therefore, we encourage scientists and citizens alike to recognize this potential disconnect and strive to be explicit about the role of data in conservation efforts.

But the extent of current citizen science practice-the types of actors and scientific disciplines who take part-is still poorly understood. This article builds on recent surveys of citizen science in PLOS One by analyzing citizen science practice in Germany and Austria through the projects on two online platforms. We find evidence supporting previous findings that citizen science is a phenomenon strongest in biodiversity and environmental monitoring research, but at home in a number of scientific fields, such as history and geography. In addition, our survey method yields new insights into citizen science projects initiated by non-scientific actors. We close by discussing additional methodological considerations in attempting to present a cross-disciplinary overview of citizen science.

However, these technologies also impose novel demands on ecologists who need to apply tools for data management and processing that are efficient, publicly available and easy to use. Such tools are starting to be developed for a wider community and here we present an approach to combine essential analytical functions for analysing large volumes of image data in marine ecological research. New information This paper describes the Koster Seafloor Observatory, an open-source approach to analysing large amounts of subsea movie data for marine ecological research. The approach incorporates three distinct modules to: manage and archive the subsea movies, involve citizen scientists to accurately classify the footage and, finally, train and test machine learning algorithms for detection of biological objects. This modular approach is based on open-source code and allows researchers to customise and further develop the presented functionalities to various types of data and questions related to analysis of marine imagery. We tested our approach for monitoring cold water corals in a Marine Protected Area in Sweden using videos from remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs). Our study resulted in a machine learning model with an adequate performance, which was entirely trained with classifications provided by citizen scientists. We illustrate the application of machine learning models for automated inventories and monitoring of cold water corals. Our approach shows how citizen science can be used to effectively extract occurrence and abundance data for key ecological species and habitats from underwater footage. We conclude that the combination of open-source tools, citizen science systems, machine learning and high performance computational resources are key to successfully analyse large amounts of underwater imagery in the future.

FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						intermittent streams; citizen science; participatory science; crowdsourcing; non-traditional data; data quality; accuracy; smartphone application	NON-PERENNIAL RIVERS; INTERMITTENT RIVERS; EPHEMERAL CHANNELS; VARIABILITY; RESILIENCE; RESISTANCE; DROUGHT	Even though more than half of the global river network does not have continuous flow, temporary (i.e., non-perennial) streams are poorly represented in traditional monitoring networks. Therefore, new approaches are needed to monitor these streams. Citizen science provides an interesting opportunity as people, equipped with smartphones, can observe the flow state of temporary streams. Such observations can go beyond a simple classification of flow vs. no flow and include ecologically important states, such as standing water, isolated pools, or wet streambeds. However, the quality of citizen science data for temporary streams has so far not been thoroughly assessed. Therefore, we asked more than 1,200 people during 23 field days to visually determine the flow state of eight temporary streams based on six classes ranging from a dry streambed to flowing water. Participants could most clearly distinguish a flowing stream from a non-flowing stream. The overall agreement between participants was 66%; 83% of the selected flow states were within one class of the most frequently selected flow state. The agreement with the expert was lower (56% chose the same class, and 79% chose a state within one class). Inconsistencies between the selected flow state and answers to specific yes-no statements about the temporary stream were largest for the dry streambed and damp/wet streambed states. These discrepancies were partly caused by participants looking at different parts of the stream (i.e., participants considered the flow state for a location further upstream or downstream). To ensure that all participants determine the flow state comparably, we recommend clear definitions of the flow state classes, detailed information on the exact location for which the flow state needs to be determined, as well as more training.

It is based on exploiting the idle time of ordinary online machines with the consent of their owners. Target applications are generally scientific projects requiring a huge amount of computational resources. Existing VC platforms raise several challenges. This work attempts to bring solutions for two defeats. The first one is the involvement of volunteers; the decreasing of participants affects the global performances. To cope with this, a new social volunteer computing environment is proposed in order to involve more volunteers. The second addressed problem is the task scheduling, which aims to optimize the use of resources. The proposed algorithm generates for each resource's class, a number of tasks whose cost of execution reflects the momentary capacity of the resources. The new solutions are validated through a theory of number's project, called "Collatz Conjecture."

Most current research involving sequence analysis for these control signals involve significantly smaller data sets, however volunteer computing can provide the necessary computational power to make full genome analysis feasible. A fault tolerant and asynchronous implementation of Gibbs sampling using the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is presented, which is currently being used to analyze the intergenic regions of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. In only three months of limited operation, the project has had over 1,800 volunteered computing hosts participate and obtains a number of samples required for analysis over 400 times faster than an average computing host for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis dataset. We feel that the preliminary results for this project provide a strong argument for the feasibility and public interest of a volunteer computing project for this type of bioinformaties.

Moreover, to tap the potentials of citizen science from the perspective of deliberative democracy, it needs to move towards a more empowered approach, in which citizens do not only deliver data points, but also, in invited or uninvited settings, participate in discussions about the goals and implications of research. Integrating citizen science into the deliberative systems approach embeds it in a broader framework of democratic theory and suggests the transmission of certain practical strategies (e.g., randomized sampling). It can also contribute to realism about both the potentials and the limits of citizen science. As part of a deliberative system, citizen science cannot, and need not, be the only place in which reforms are necessary for creating stronger ties between science and society and for aligning science with democratic values.

Mapping species distributions in 2 weeks using citizen science	INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY			English	Article						Bias; citizen science; insect; species distributions; Wasps	POPULATION-DYNAMICS; DIVERSITY; WASPS; BIAS	Ecological citizen science initiatives are growing in popularity with the increasing realisation of the potential for occurrence records to contribute information on biodiversity. Citizen science data are, however, justifiably criticised for misidentification, uneven sampling, incomplete detection or selective reporting. Here, we test the accuracy of citizen science data for UK social wasp (Vespinae) species' distributions. We compared data collected over 2 weeks by members of the public setting out baited traps across the UK and sending captured specimens for expert identification [1294 locations; 6680 wasps; three dominant species Vespula vulgaris (44%), Vespula germanica (44%) and Vespa crabro (6%)], with a four-decade long-term data set established by the Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society (BWARS). The citizen science data were significantly less spatially biased than the long-term data, but they were more urban-biased. Species distribution modelling showed that, for Vespa crabro, just 2 weeks of citizen science generated coverage comparable to more than four decades of expert recording. Overall, we show that citizen science can be an extremely powerful and robust method for mapping insect diversity and distributions. We suggest that cautious combination of citizen science data with long-term expert surveying could be a highly reliable method for monitoring biodiversity.

To foster environmental and conservation goals, citizen science can (i) generate new knowledge, (ii) enhance awareness raising and facilitate in-depth learning as well as (iii) enable civic participation. Here, we investigate how these aims are realised in citizen science projects and assess needs and challenges for advancing citizen science and stimulating future initiatives. To this end, we conducted a quantitative, web-based survey with 143 experts from the environmental and educational sector in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Our findings show that citizen science project managers pursue goals related to all three areas of potential impact. Interestingly, enabling civic participation was considered slightly less important in relation to generating new knowledge and creating learning opportunities. Different areas of necessary action emerge from our analysis. To fully realize the potential of citizen science for generating knowledge, priority should be given to enhance capacities to more effectively share research results with the scientific community through publication, also in scientific journals. Systematic evaluation is needed to gain a better understanding of citizen science learning outcomes, for which criteria need to be developed. Fostering project formats that allow participants to get involved in the whole research process from posing the study question to implementing results - could enhance the transformative aspect of citizen science at a societal level. Important structural aspects that need to be addressed include adjustments in funding schemes, facilitation of communication between citizens and academia-based scientists, and offers for training, guidance and networking.

This presents the challenge to uncover the 'hidden' citizen science landscapes. The main objective of this paper is to explore the (public) representation of citizen science (CS) projects and to describe their heterogeneity. The study aims to answer the question of what type of projects in the Czech Republic meet the definition of citizen science. Based on a specific methodological data-base search approach, we compiled a set of CS projects (N = 73). During the classification process, two general citizen science categories were identified. The first group (N = 46) consists of "pure" CS projects with a prevalence towards the natural sciences, principally ornithology, and thus corresponding to general European trends. Citizens usually participate in such research in the form of data collection and basic interpretation, and a high level of cooperation between academia and NGOs was detected. The second group of "potential" CS projects (N = 27) entails various forms of public participation in general, frequently coordinated by NGOs. Based on these results, we discuss the position of citizen science in the Czech Republic, including socially-oriented citizen science. Further research is strongly encouraged to achieve a more in-depth insight into this social phenomenon.

However, rigorous evaluation of citizen science outcomes is limited, particularly those related to social capital and environmental stewardship. Social science can help to address this gap as it can identify barriers that hinder the success of citizen science programs and drivers that promote positive outcomes, such as social norms, community engagement, and effective communication strategies. However, little has been written about how academic partners in social science fields can engage with citizen science practitioners. In this paper we describe seven design components essential to the success of a long-term research collaboration between academic social scientists and staff of Billion Oyster Project (BOP), a nonprofit environmental organization whose mission is to restore oyster reefs to New York Harbor through citizen science, restoration, and public education initiatives. We describe how over an eight-year period, social science methodologies and findings were used to inform BOP's environmental citizen science and volunteer programing and management. We argue that collaborative research is essential for the advancement of our field, and that action-driven research partnerships should become a key component of effective citizen science programs.

J	Heinisch, B				Heinisch, Barbara			The Role of Translation in Citizen Science to Foster Social Innovation	FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						translation; localization; adaptation; social change; terminology	KNOWLEDGE; CHALLENGES; METRICS; IMPACT	Citizen science has become a world-wide phenomenon. Especially for citizen science projects that have a global reach, translation is crucial to overcome language and cultural barriers to reach members of the public. Translation, understood as the transfer of meaning (of a text) from one language into another language, is crucial for the transmission of information, knowledge and (social) innovations. Therefore, this paper examines the role of translation and terminology used in citizen science projects and how translation can foster (or impede) social innovation through citizen science activities. Based on a set of predefined criteria derived from the social innovation literature, this paper analyzes the factors that contribute to (social) innovation in citizen science by means of translation. A specific focus of the case study is on the aspects of agency, institutions, and social systems. The results demonstrate that translation in citizen science may support a change of social practices as ingredients of social innovations. Additional research is needed to further understand the implications of translation in citizen science and its effects on social innovation. Nevertheless, this work has been one of the first attempts to examine the relation between translation, citizen science and social innovation.

Citizen science: a new approach to advance ecology, education, and conservation	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Citizen science; History; Human-natural system; Web-based approach; Worldwide case studies	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; RANGE CONTRACTIONS; POPULATION TRENDS; THOREAUS CONCORD; MONITORING DATA; FARMLAND BIRDS; PHENOLOGY; JAPAN	Citizen science has a long history in the ecological sciences and has made substantial contributions to science, education, and society. Developments in information technology during the last few decades have created new opportunities for citizen science to engage ever larger audiences of volunteers to help address some of ecology's most pressing issues, such as global environmental change. Using online tools, volunteers can find projects that match their interests and learn the skills and protocols required to develop questions, collect data, submit data, and help process and analyze data online. Citizen science has become increasingly important for its ability to engage large numbers of volunteers to generate observations at scales or resolutions unattainable by individual researchers. As a coupled natural and human approach, citizen science can also help researchers access local knowledge and implement conservation projects that might be impossible otherwise. In Japan, however, the value of citizen science to science and society is still underappreciated. Here we present case studies of citizen science in Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and describe how citizen science is used to tackle key questions in ecology and conservation, including spatial and macro-ecology, management of threatened and invasive species, and monitoring of biodiversity. We also discuss the importance of data quality, volunteer recruitment, program evaluation, and the integration of science and human systems in citizen science projects. Finally, we outline some of the primary challenges facing citizen science and its future.

Government regulatory monitors do not have the spatial resolution to provide air quality information at the neighborhood or personal scale. We describe the A Day in the Life program, an approach to participatory air monitoring that engages youth in collecting data that they can then analyze and use to take action. Academics partnered with Los Angeles-based youth environmental justice organizations to combine personal air monitoring, participatory science, and digital storytelling to build capacity to address local air quality issues. Eighteen youth participants from four different neighborhoods wore portable personal PM2.5 (fine particles <2.5 mu m in diameter) monitors for a day in each of their respective communities, documenting and mapping their exposure to PM2.5 during their daily routine. Air monitoring was coupled with photography and videos to document what they experienced over the course of their day. The PM2.5 exposure during the day for participants averaged 10.7 mu g/m(3), although the range stretched from <1 to 180 mu g/m(3). One-third of all measurements were taken <300 m from a freeway. Overall, we demonstrate a method to increase local youth-centered understanding of personal exposures, pollution sources, and vulnerability to air quality.

Engaging the public in citizen science is challenging and, when involving online participation, data entry, and map use, becomes even more daunting. Given these new challenges, citizen science websites must be easy to use, result in positive overall satisfaction for many different users, support many different tasks, and ensure data quality. To begin reaching these goals, we built a geospatially enabled citizen science website, evaluated its usability, and gained experience by working with and listening to citizens using the website. We sought to determine general perceptions, discover potential problems, and iteratively improve website features. Although the website was rated positively overall, map-based tasks identified a wide range of problems. Given our results, we redesigned the website, improved the content, enhanced the ease of use, simplified the map interface, and added features. We discuss citizen science websites in relation to online Public Participation Geographic Information Systems, examine the role(s) websites may play in the citizen science research model, discuss how citizen science research advances GIScience, and offer guidelines to improve citizen-based web mapping applications.

J	Minkman, E; van der Sanden, M; Rutten, M				Minkman, Ellen; van der Sanden, Maarten; Rutten, Martine			Practitioners' viewpoints on citizen science in water management: a case study in Dutch regional water resource management	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							TOOL	In recent years, governmental institutes have started to use citizen science as a form of public participation. The Dutch water authorities are among them. They face pressure on the water governance system and a water awareness gap among the general public, and consider citizen science a possible solution. The reasons for practitioners to engage in citizen science, and in particular those of government practitioners, have seldom been studied. This article aims to pinpoint the various viewpoints of practitioners at Dutch regional water authorities on citizen science. A Q-methodological approach was used because it allows for exploration of viewpoints and statistical analysis using a small sample size. Practitioners (33) at eight different water authorities ranked 46 statements from agree to disagree. Three viewpoints were identified with a total explained variance of 67 %. Viewpoint A considers citizen science a potential solution that can serve several purposes, thereby encouraging citizen participation in data collection and analysis. Viewpoint B considers citizen science a method for additional, illustrative data. Viewpoint C views citizen science primarily as a means of education. These viewpoints show water practitioners in the Netherlands are willing to embrace citizen science at water authorities, although there is no support for higher levels of citizen engagement.

We advocate for a transdisciplinary framework for participatory STEM learning based on the culmination of the authors' designing and complemented by reviews of extant works in youth STEM learning and engagement. Data literacy, geospatial reasoning, and community science are cornerstones in our framework because of their power to leverage and integrate the four STEM disciplines. Youth with their families are authors and designers in community problem-solving using data literacy and geospatial reasoning through participatory community science to question, analyze, and design solutions empowered by their lived experiences. Through partnerships with community organizations, families, youth, andSTEMpractitioners, we discuss howto develop and use tools and methods to design and build better spaces for youths' communities. Our aim is for more authentic, inclusive, and empowering learning opportunities that broaden youths' STEM participation. We describe our framework and the underlying commitments, design principles, expected outcomes, and limitations.

J	Cooper, CB; Shirk, J; Zuckerberg, B				Cooper, Caren B.; Shirk, Jennifer; Zuckerberg, Benjamin			The Invisible Prevalence of Citizen Science in Global Research: Migratory Birds and Climate Change	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DATA-INTENSIVE SCIENCE; SCALE; QUALITY; TOOL	Citizen science is a research practice that relies on public contributions of data. The strong recognition of its educational value combined with the need for novel methods to handle subsequent large and complex data sets raises the question: Is citizen science effective at science? A quantitative assessment of the contributions of citizen science for its core purpose scientific research - is lacking. We examined the contribution of citizen science to a review paper by ornithologists in which they formulated ten central claims about the impact of climate change on avian migration. Citizen science was never explicitly mentioned in the review article. For each of the claims, these ornithologists scored their opinions about the amount of research effort invested in each claim and how strongly the claim was supported by evidence. This allowed us to also determine whether their trust in claims was, unwittingly or not, related to the degree to which the claims relied primarily on data generated by citizen scientists. We found that papers based on citizen science constituted between 24 and 77% of the references backing each claim, with no evidence of a mistrust of claims that relied heavily on citizen-science data. We reveal that many of these papers may not easily be recognized as drawing upon volunteer contributions, as the search terms "citizen science'' and "volunteer'' would have overlooked the majority of the studies that back the ten claims about birds and climate change. Our results suggest that the significance of citizen science to global research, an endeavor that is reliant on long-term information at large spatial scales, might be far greater than is readily perceived. To better understand and track the contributions of citizen science in the future, we urge researchers to use the keyword "citizen science'' in papers that draw on efforts of non-professionals.

J	Grantz, E; Haggard, BE				Grantz, Erin E.; Haggard, Brian			Informing Volunteer Water Quality Monitoring Program Design and Watershed Planning: Case Study of StreamSmart Data Analysis in the Upper White River Basin, Arkansas	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION			English	Article						Volunteer monitoring; water quality; watershed management	LAND-USE; HABITAT; MACROINVERTEBRATES; BIAS	The watershed group H(2)Ozarks founded the StreamSmart Citizen Science Program to establish baseline and long-term water quality data for the Upper White River Basin, Arkansas. StreamSmart volunteers collect water samples and conduct habitat and macroinvertebrate community assessments at >20 sites across a land use-land cover (LULC) gradient. Since 2020, H(2)Ozarks has adaptively assessed the program to ensure that the investment in water quality data meets core goals, with particular interest in planning tools and aligning expectations of volunteer effort with the level of training and support. Study objectives were to use StreamSmart data to 1) facilitate understanding of water quality response to stressors in the basin using a range of methods (Spearman rank correlation, non-parametric changepoint analysis, and categorical and regression tree analysis) and 2) explore implications for program design and watershed planning. Water chemistry-LULC relationships were in-line with prior regional studies, as well as global patterns. Detected thresholds and hierarchy provide potential targets for managing LULC change to protect water quality, but further analysis is warranted to refine these relationships. Macroinvertebrate stressor-response was most detectable for sensitive and less sensitive taxa and for habitat index components, suggesting potential to streamline these programmatic elements. Study findings for StreamSmart should also be informative for other small-scale volunteer monitoring programs with limited resources, but which actively evaluate the types of data and program activities that yield a maximum scientific return on investment.

J	Atias, O; Shavit, A; Kali, Y; Baram-Tsabari, A				Atias, Osnat; Shavit, Ayelet; Kali, Yael; Baram-Tsabari, Ayelet			Deciphering the role of epistemic injustice in school-based citizen science: Sources, implications, and possible ways for mitigation	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING			English	Article; Early Access						citizen science; epistemic injustice; justice-oriented science education; school-based citizen science	LOCAL KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; JUSTICE; GOVERNANCE; ENGAGEMENT; MANAGEMENT; TEACHERS; POLITICS; HISTORY; AGENCY	Participation in citizen science, a research approach in which nonscientists take part in performing research, is a growing practice in schools. A main premise in school-based citizen science is that through their participation, students and teachers make meaningful contributions to the advancement of science. However, such initiatives may encounter difficulties in drawing on students' and teachers' knowledge and incorporating their voice in research processes and outcomes, partly due to established knowledge hierarchies in both science and schools. This research theoretically examines misuses of students' and teachers' knowledge in school-based citizen science that can be defined as an epistemic injustice. This term describes wrongful evaluations and considerations of people's knowledge or perspectives. Based on existing theoretical work on epistemic injustice, we first map out epistemic justifications for public participation in science and discuss deficiencies in current forms of citizen science that lead to the perseverance of epistemic injustice. Then, we identify and characterize four forms through which epistemic injustice may be manifested in school-based citizen science. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by illustrative examples from citizen science projects enacted in schools, demonstrating cases where epistemic injustice toward students and teachers was either instigated or mitigated. We discuss implications toward educational goals and the design of school-based citizen science, suggesting that epistemic injustice can be reduced or avoided by delegating authorities to schools, maximizing teacher and student agency, and leveraging schools' community connections. Overall, this research establishes theoretical grounds for examinations of epistemic injustice in school-based citizen science.

New and non-traditional sources of data are required. Citizen science is an emerging example of a non-traditional data source that is already making a contribution. In this Perspective, we present a roadmap that outlines how citizen science can be integrated into the formal Sustainable Development Goals reporting mechanisms. Success will require leadership from the United Nations, innovation from National Statistical Offices and focus from the citizen-science community to identify the indicators for which citizen science can make a real contribution.

Clustering community science data to infer songbird migratory connectivity in the Western Hemisphere	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; birds; community science; connectivity; conservation; migration	CITIZEN SCIENCE; MONITORING DATA; TRACKING; NETWORK; SITES; EBIRD	Migratory connectivity describes the spatial linkage among migrating individuals through time. Accounting for it is necessary for full annual cycle conservation planning, to avoid uneven protection leading to overall population declines. However, conventional methods used to study migratory connectivity usually demand substantial fiscal and human resources. We present a methodology that infers patterns of migratory connectivity for songbirds using relative abundance models created from eBird, a global community science program. We compare our inferences with previously described patterns of migratory connectivity for two species assumed to exhibit broadscale parallel migration strategies: wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) and Wilson's warbler (Cardellina pusilla). Initial findings suggest that our method has the potential to be a rapid and inexpensive way to infer broad patterns of connectivity for species that do not engage in leapfrog migration nor deviate much from parallel migration. Our flexible framework can be used to guide sampling designs for studies of migratory connectivity and to generate hypotheses for species in need of urgent conservation planning for which migratory connectivity has not yet been established.

J	Dunkley, R				Dunkley, Ria			Ecological kin-making in the multispecies muddle: An analytical framework for understanding embodied environmental citizen science experiences	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						citizen science; ecological caring; ecopedagogy; embodied encounter; narrative analysis; new humanism		Despite the current proliferation of citizen science projects, the affordances of ecological citizen science to generate transformational thinking amongst project participants are seldom considered. This study investigated citizen science as an experiential ecopedagogic praxis that may provide a context for developing relational perspectives and sensorial engagements between human and non-human participants. A new humanist, phenomenological standpoint and narrative analysis framework were adopted. The narratives of five river monitoring citizen science participants are presented herein to illustrate an emergent Ecological kin-making through citizen science framework. Participants' narratives demonstrate how individuals engaged in caring practices through six embodied stages of ecological kin-making through citizen science: encountering the river (1); recognising the non-human world (2); river-bank identification (3); developing a sense of response-ability (4); enacting responsibility (5); and enhanced ecological kinship (6). As characterised by the infinity-loop framework, citizen science emerges from this study as an attuned, ongoing, and caring praxis of ecological kin-making. New co-species kinship relationships are formed, maintained, and strengthened through participation. The study highlights that where citizen science projects are designed with a participant community focus, they can create the conditions for self-directed and lifelong ecopedagogy that could be transformational for humans and non-humans in times of ecological and climate crisis. The study implies the catalytic validity of citizen science to provide a space-time context for participants to enact a 'response-ability' toward local environments and human and non-human dwellers, vital to enabling participants to experience a sense of agency and to take local action on environmental issues.

Recent innovation in EO means provision of analysis ready data and data cubes, which allows for rapid use of EO data. This in combination with processing technologies, such as Google Earth Engine and open source algorithms/software for EO data integration and analyses, has afforded an explosion of information to answer research questions and/or inform policy making. However, there is still a need for both training and validation data within EO projects - often this can be challenging to obtain. It has been suggested that citizen science can help here to provide these data, yet there is some perceived hesitancy in using citizen science within EO projects. This paper reports on the Citizen Science 4 EO (Citizens4EO) project that aimed to obtain an in-depth understanding of researchers' and practitioners' experiences with citizen science data in EO within the UK. Through a mixed methods approach (online and in-depth surveys and a spotlight case study) it was found that although the benefits of using citizen science data in EO projects were many (and highlighted in the spotlighted "Slavery from Space" case study), there were a number of common concerns around using citizen science. These were around the mechanics of deploying citizen science and the unreliability of a potentially misinformed or undertrained citizen base. As such, comparing the results of this study with those of a similar survey undertaken in 2016, it is apparent that progress towards optimizing citizen science use in EO has been incremental but positive with evidence of the realization of the benefits of citizen science for EO (Citizens4EO). As such, we conclude by offering priority action areas to support further use of citizen science by the EO community within the UK, which ultimately should be adopted further afield.

Citizen science is increasingly common in the biomedical sciences, including the fields of genetics and human genomics. Genomic citizen science initiatives are diverse and involve citizen scientists in collecting genetic data, solving genetic puzzles, and conducting experiments in community laboratories. At the same time that genomic citizen science is presenting new opportunities for individuals to participate in scientific discovery, it is also challenging norms regarding the manner in which scientific research outputs are managed. In this review, we present a typology of genomic citizen science initiatives, describe ethical and legal foundations for recognizing genomic citizen scientists' claims of credit for and control of research outputs, and detail how such claims are or might be addressed in practice across a variety of initiatives.

In this paper, we explore how participation in biodiversity citizen science projects is correlated to different dimensions of trust in science. We conduct a quantitative study through an online survey of 1,199 individuals, 586 of them being part of a biodiversity citizen science program in France. Our results suggest that participation-related trust is more exhaustive - it covers more dimensions of the scientific endeavor - than education-related trust.

USAGE OF SESSION METRICS TO TASKS SCHEDULING IN BROWSER-BASED VOLUNTEER COMPUTING SYSTEMS	RADIO ELECTRONICS COMPUTER SCIENCE CONTROL			Ukrainian	Article						distributed browser-based volunteer computing; tasks scheduling; tasks package; tasks distribution; session metrics	PLATFORM	Context. The study is devoted to the development an adaptive method for scheduling tasks in distributed browser-based volunteer computing systems. which is constructed on the session metrics of a volunteer user. This allows server to allocate tasks to each volunteer for computing, depending on the characteristics of his computing processes. More productive clients will receive more tasks, maximizing resource utilization, reducing server load and facilitating scaling; less productive clients will receive fewer tasks, solving the problem of excessive blocking of input data. Objective. The aim of the study is increasing the efficiency of distributed browser-based volunteer computing systems by using session metrics to tasks scheduling. Method. The session metrics that determine the behavior of volunteer users are described. The indicators that characterize the progress of the computational process on user systems were introduced. The formula to calculate the amount of input data for distribution to client is proposed. It takes into account the capacity of the client's system and the tendency of processes on its system. Simulation was done using different methods to calculate the amount of input data on the basis of the existing system of volunteer computing. To evaluate the performance of such systems, the total number of user hits to the server part and the total number of calculated results were used. Results. The proposed method is applied in the existing browser-based volunteer computing system. A comparison of the results of the proposed method with the existing ones showed a decrease in server load and an increase of the number of calculated results when session metrics are used. Conclusions. The simulation confirmed the convenience and efficiency of session metrics usage to tasks scheduling. The presented approach provides scalability of distributed browser-based volunteer computing systems. The prospects of further research are to use the users' statistics and information from their browsers to calculate the amount of input data for distribution to client.	[Rybachok, N. A.; Oros, B.

J	Pierce, R; Evram, M				Pierce, Robin; Evram, Mariana			Getting it right: implementing data protection in citizen science research	INSIGHTS-THE UKSG JOURNAL			English	Article						data protection; citizen science; right to data protection; privacy in research; GDPR		As citizen science projects increase in number, scope and relevance to policy, the conduct of the underlying research is likely to come under greater scrutiny, particularly if any resulting research findings are to be regarded as legitimate. Among the most important aspects of research ethics scrutiny is the handling of data. The ever-increasing attention to the data protection rights of citizens can be seen across research domains, from health to environmental impacts. Careful attention to data protection is essential to the sustainability of citizen science for practical reasons as well. Complying with data protection laws is not optional. It is a legal requirement. Failure to meet the requirements can result in substantial fines, which most citizen science projects can ill afford. Moreover, the scientific, political and legal viability of citizen science hinges on getting data protection right. This article sets out some of the key data protection considerations that commonly arise in conducting a citizen science project.

Citizen science projects have been remarkably successful in advancing scientific knowledge, and contributions from citizen scientists now provide a vast quantity of data about species occurrence and distribution around the world. Most citizen science projects also strive to help participants learn about the organisms they are observing and to experience the process by which scientific investigations are conducted. Developing and implementing public data-collection projects that yield both scientific and educational outcomes requires significant effort. This article describes the model for building and operating citizen science projects that has evolved at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology over the past two decades. We hope that our model will inform the fields of biodiversity monitoring, biological research, and science education while providing a window into the culture of citizen science.

However, financial and logistical constraints make it impossible for taxonomic experts to conduct thorough surveys in most locations. One popular approach to offset the lack of expert sampling is using community science data collected by the public, curated, and made available for research. These datasets, however, contain different biases than those typically present in data collected through conventional survey practices, often leading to different results. Recent studies have used massive datasets generated over large areas; however, less is known about the results obtained at smaller scales or with more limited sampling intervals. We compared butterfly observations in eastern Oklahoma using a dataset obtained from the popular community science website iNaturalist and one collected during targeted surveys of glade habitats conducted by taxonomic experts. At the county-level scale, the relative abundances of butterfly species correlated well between the glade surveys and the iNaturalist observations, and there was no difference in the relative abundance of different butterfly families between the two survey methods. However, as anticipated, the conventional surveys outperformed the community science data in measuring biodiversity at a smaller geographic scale.	[Harman, Alexander J.; Hoback, W.

Recently participatory sensing has attracted considerable attention of research community with a number of open issues and challenges. Motivating people to participate in sensing the phenomena around and report those to dedicated servers is the key factor for the success of this system. Different incentive mechanisms have been proposed to increase the participation rate of users in this context. This paper presents a brief survey of these techniques identifying their respective limitations and finally reports the issues yet to be addressed to develop an widely acceptable incentive model.

While the idea of volunteer computing offers many exciting new prospects in global supercomputing and collaboration, its realization involves many challenging research issues that need to be addressed. In this paper, we present a flexible object-oriented framework using Java and HOPE that allows programmers to experiment with different approaches to these issues by simply extending and interconnecting basic library components. We also present results from a distributed web-crawling application written using the framework. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Phenological mismatch between trees and wildflowers: Reconciling divergent findings in two recent analyses	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						citizen science; climate change; community science; global change ecology; herbarium collections; nature's notebook; phenological escape; phenology; spring ephemeral wildflowers; spring-blooming wildflowers	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLANT-RESPONSES; FLOWERING TIME; SCIENCE; LEAF	1. Recent evidence suggests that community science and herbarium datasets yield similar estimates of species' phenological sensitivities to temperature. Despite this, two recent studies by Alecrim et al. (2023) and Miller et al. (2022) found very different results when using different data sources (community science and herbarium specimens, respectively) to investigate whether warming threatens wildflowers with phenological mismatch in relation to shading by deciduous trees. 2. Here, we investigated whether differences between the two studies' results could be reconciled by testing four hypotheses related to model design, species, spatiotemporal data extent and phenophase. 3. Hybrid model structures brought results from the two datasets closer together but did not fully reconcile the differences between the studies. Neither the species nor the phenophase selected for analysis seemed to be responsible for differences in results. Cropping the datasets to match spatial and temporal extents appeared to reconcile most differences but only at the cost of much higher uncertainty associated with reduced sample size. 4. Synthesis: Our analysis suggests that although species-level estimates of phenological sensitivity may be similar between community science and herbarium datasets, inherent differences in the types and extent of data may lead to contradictory inference about complex biotic interactions. We conclude that, until community science data repositories expand to match the range of climate conditions present in herbarium collections or until herbarium collections match the spatial extent and temporal frequency of community science repositories, ecological studies should ideally be evaluated using both datasets to test the possibility of biased results from either.

Crowdsourcing conservation: The role of citizen science in securing a future for seagrass	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Citizen science; Community engagement; Seagrass conservation; Seagrass research; Seagrass	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; DIVERSITY; MARINE; VOLUNTEERS; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; PATTERNS; MEADOWS	Seagrass meadows are complex social-ecological systems. Understanding seagrass meadows demands a fresh approach integrating "the human dimension". Citizen science is widely acknowledged for providing significant contributions to science, education, society and policy. Although the take up of citizen science in the marine environment has been slow, the need for such methods to fill vast information gaps is arguably great. Seagrass meadows are easy to access and provide an example of where citizen science is expanding. Technological developments have been pivotal to this, providing new opportunities for citizens to engage with seagrass. The increasing use of online tools has created opportunities to collect and submit as well as help process and analyse data.

This includes the provision of citizen science opportunities that encompass water quality monitoring, assessment of polluting outfalls, surveying riverine plastic pollution, mapping and control of freshwater invasive species and assessment of the biological health of rivers. In some cases, citizen science data has led directly to action being taken to address a pollution source and, in one example, indirectly influenced policy focus. Online platforms play an increasingly important role in capturing and portraying citizen science data. A large multi-stakeholder initiative aims to achieve a step-change in the contribution of citizen science to the assessment of river health including development of a standardised national framework. There is potential for citizen science to widen the monitoring of freshwater to encompass toxic chemicals.

How can bottom-up citizen science restore public trust in environmental governance and sciences? Recommendations from three case studies	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Citizen Science; Public; Trust; Policy; Knowledge co-production; Global challenges	PARTICIPATION; ENGAGEMENT	Citizen science is currently at the forefront of environmental scientific research and public policy for its potential to improve environmental governance, restore epistemic trust and help address some of the most stressing environmental challenges. Although citizen science is gaining increasing popularity, there is little empirical evidence to support these claims and demonstrate how bottom-up citizen science shapes public trust in environmental governance and science. In this paper we reflect on three grassroot environmental citizen science initiatives in Cameroon, Japan, and the UK to identify and present an instrumental framework which includes trustee attributes and conditions that influence how epistemic trust is shaped, and which should inform citizen science and other participatory practices. We explain that citizen science is an approach which enables political processes through the construction of well-informed techno-scientific arguments, which expose deficit assumptions about the public's ability to participate in knowledge co-production process. To avoid repeating the failures of the past and risk amplifying issues of public distrust further, we provide suggestions built around key trustee attributes which can be incorporated in citizen science practices and we urge that environmental policy needs to create clear policy frameworks to enable the generation of actionable data, especially when such approaches are initiated and implemented as instrumental public participation methods.

Accounting for spatial autocorrelation and environment are important to derive robust bat population trends from citizen science data	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Bayesian hierarchical modelling; Biodiversity indicators; Chiroptera; Community science; INLA; Passive acoustic monitoring; Sampling biases	BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; HABITAT USE; BIODIVERSITY; UK; PIPISTRELLUS; REGRESSION; MODELS	Monitoring wildlife populations is essential if global targets to reverse biodiversity declines are to be met. Recent analysis of data from the UK's long-term National Bat Monitoring Programme (NBMP) suggests stable or increasing population trends for many bat species, and these statistics help inform progress towards national biodiversity targets. However, although based on robust citizen science survey designs, it is unknown how sensitive these trends are to spatial and environmental biases. Here we use Bayesian hierarchical modelling with integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), to examine the impact of these types of biases on the population trends using relative occupancy of four species monitored by the NBMP Field Survey in Great Britain (GB): Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, Nyctalus noctula and Eptesicus serotinus. Where possible, we also disaggregated trends to national levels using the best model per species to determine if national differences in trends remain once sampling biases are accounted for. Although we found evidence of spatial clustering in the NBMP Field Survey locations, the previously reported GB-wide population trends are broadly robust to spatial autocorrelation. In most species, accounting for spatial autocorrelation and species-environment relationships improved model fit. The nationally disaggregated models highlighted that GB-wide trends mask differences between England and Scotland, consistent with previous analysis of these data, as well as illustrating large gaps in survey effort, especially in Wales. We suggest that although bat population trends were found to be broadly robust to sampling biases present in these data, small differences could propagate over time and this impact is likely to be more severe in less structured citizen science data. Therefore, ensuring trends are robust to sampling biases present in citizen science datasets is critical to effective monitoring of progress towards biodiversity targets, managing populations sustainably, and ultimately a reversal of global declines.

Using community science to map western monarch butterflies (<i>Danaus plexippus</i>) in spring	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						annual lifecycle conservation; citizen science; community science; conservation of migratory animals; monarch butterfly; western monarch	DECLINES	Migratory animals follow seasonal cycles comprising linked phases often with different habitat requirements and demographic processes. Conservation of migratory species therefore must consider the full seasonal cycle to identify points limiting population viability. For western monarch butterflies, which have experienced significant declines, early spring is considered a critical period in the annual population cycle. However, records of western monarchs in early spring, when overall abundance is lowest, have historically been extremely limited. We used a community science initiative, the Western Monarch Mystery Challenge, to collect data on monarch distribution throughout the western United States between February 14th and April 22nd over 3 years. Using data from the Western Monarch Mystery Challenge and iNaturalist, we identified potential breeding habitat for western monarchs in early spring that spanned a large geographic area and several ecoregions. We observed monarchs in early spring that likely eclosed in the current year, suggesting that population expansion from overwintering sites reflects both movement and population growth. The number of records of western monarchs from early spring was higher during the Mystery Challenge (33.0/year) than earlier years (5.1/year). This study demonstrates the potential for and limitations of community science to increase our understanding of species at points in the life cycle when they are rare.

J	Qiu, FD; Wu, F; Chen, GH				Qiu, Fudong; Wu, Fan; Chen, Guihai			Privacy and Quality Preserving Multimedia Data Aggregation for Participatory Sensing Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Participatory sensing; privacy preservation; K-anonymity; erasure coding		With the popularity of mobile wireless devices equipped with various kinds of sensing abilities, a new service paradigm named participatory sensing has emerged to provide users with brand new life experience. However, the wide application of participatory sensing has its own challenges, among which privacy and multimedia data quality preservations are two critical problems. Unfortunately, none of the existing work has fully solved the problem of privacy and quality preserving participatory sensing with multimedia data. In this paper, we propose SLICER, which is the first k-anonymous privacy preserving scheme for participatory sensing with multimedia data. SLICER integrates a data coding technique and message transfer strategies, to achieve strong protection of participants' privacy, while maintaining high data quality. Specifically, we study two kinds of data transfer strategies, namely transfer on meet up (TMU) and minimal cost transfer (MCT). For MCT, we propose two different but complimentary algorithms, including an approximation algorithm and a heuristic algorithm, subject to different strengths of the requirement. Furthermore, we have implemented SLICER and evaluated its performance using publicly released taxi traces. Our evaluation results show that SLICER achieves high data quality, with low computation and communication overhead.

J	Geurts, EM; Reynolds, JD; Starzomski, BM				Geurts, Ellyne; Reynolds, John; Starzomski, Brian			Not all who wander are lost: Trail bias in community science	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CITIZEN SCIENCE; SPECIES RICHNESS; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; IMPACTS; LICHENS; NETWORK; FUNGI; EBIRD; TOOL	The exponential growth and interest in community science programs is producing staggering amounts of biodiversity data across broad temporal and spatial scales. Large community science datasets such as iNaturalist and eBird are allowing ecologists and conservation biologists to answer novel questions that were not possible before. However, the opportunistic nature of many of these enormous datasets leads to biases. Spatial bias is a common problem, where observations are biased towards points of access like roads and trails. iNaturalist-a popular biodiversity community science platform-exhibits strong spatial biases, but it is unclear how these biases affect the quality of biodiversity data collected. Thus, we tested whether fine-scale spatial bias due to sampling from trails affects taxonomic richness estimates. We compared timed transects with experienced iNaturalist observers on and off trails in British Columbia, Canada. Using generalized linear mixed models, we found higher overall taxonomic richness on trails than off trails. In addition, we found more exotic as well as native taxa on trails than off trails. There was no difference between on and off trail observations for species that are rarely observed. Thus, fine-scale spatial bias from trails does not reduce the quality of biodiversity measurements, a promising result for those interested in using iNaturalist data for research and conservation management.

Citizen science across two centuries reveals phenological change among plant species and functional groups in the Northeastern US	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						citizen science; climate change impacts; community science; historical data; long-term monitoring; phenological shift; plant phenology; pollination syndrome	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; DECIDUOUS FORESTS; SPRING PHENOLOGY; RESPONSES; TIMES; LEAF; TEMPERATE; PATTERNS	Understanding the breadth and complexity of changes in phenology is limited by the availability of long-term historical data sets with broad geographic range. We compare a recently discovered historical data set of plant phenology observations collected across the state of New York (1826-1872) to contemporary volunteer-contributed observations (2009-2017) to evaluate changes in plant phenology between time periods. These multi-site, multi-taxa phenology data matched with temperature data uniquely extend historical observations back in time prior to the major atmospheric effects of the Industrial Revolution. The majority of the 36 trees, shrubs and forbs that comprised our analysable data set flowered and leafed out earlier in contemporary years than in the early to mid-19th century. This shift is associated with a warming trend in mean January-to-April temperatures, with flowering and leafing advancing on average 3 days/degrees C earlier. On average, plants flowered 10.5 days earlier and leafed out 19 days earlier in the contemporary period. Urban areas exhibit more advanced phenology than their rural counterparts overall, and insect-pollinated trees show more advanced phenology than wind-pollinated trees and seasonality and growth form explain significant variation in flowering phenology. The greatest rates of temperature sensitivity and change between time periods for flowering are seen in early-season species, particularly trees. Changes in the timing of leaf out are the most advanced for trees and shrubs in urban areas. Synthesis. Citizen science observations across two centuries reveal a dramatic, climate-driven shift to earlier leaf out and flowering. The magnitude of advancement varies across settings, species and functional groups, and illustrates how long-term monitoring and citizen science efforts are invaluable for ecological forecasting and discovery.

Researchers working in this domain are applying online citizen science as a scalable distributed data analysis approach, with recent research demonstrating that non-experts can productively contribute to tasks such as the segmentation of organelles in volume electron microscopy data. This, alongside the growing challenge to rapidly process the large amounts of biological volumetric data now routinely produced, means there is increasing interest within the research community to apply online citizen science for the analysis of data in this context. Here, we synthesise core methodological principles and practices for applying citizen science for analysis of biological volumetric data. We collate and share the knowledge and experience of multiple research teams who have applied online citizen science for the analysis of volumetric biological data using the Zooniverse platform (www.zooniverse.org). We hope this provides inspiration and practical guidance regarding how contributor effort via online citizen science may be usefully applied in this domain.

More recently, this approach has gained increasing attention from various quarters outside the traditional remit of professionalized science, which include local governments, civil society organizations (CSOs), professional networks, and cooperatives. These entities recognize citizen science as a practical method that harnesses the collective resources of a community to address pressing local concerns and promote a robust participatory democracy. Emerging initiatives include citizen observatories, data cooperatives, and collaboration platforms. Despite the growing popularity, managing citizen science initiatives (involving numerous participants over an extended period of time) poses considerable challenges. Leaders of citizen science initiatives grapple with difficulties that appear formidable to overcome. At present, the democratic potential of citizen science necessitates further development and scrutiny from social and political actors. Critics frequently underscore a disparity between the democratic ideals associated with citizen science and its current practical implementation. This article outlines the primary benefits and challenges associated with the democratization of citizen science. It builds from the empirical research of the ISEED project(1) as well as the theoretical contribution of the Right to the Smart City project(2) and formulates 10 key recommendations to citizen science project leaders.

We operationalize the citizen science participation-behavior model for a hydrologic monitoring program in Mexico to evaluate how citizen science participation influences these outcomes. Volunteers were surveyed before, two weeks, and six months after the training, and semi-structured interviews were conducted six months post-training with volunteers and dropouts. While surveys showed that participation had limited impacts on knowledge, retrospective interviews revealed self-described differences in volunteer and dropout environmental identity, self-efficacy, and view of citizen science as a conservation activity. Results show participation spurred volunteers to engage in some activist behaviors. The study provides important evidence concerning the influence of citizen science participation in the Global South on behavioral outcomes and helps inform how to design and implement future citizen science programs.

Three Frontiers for the Future of Biodiversity Research Using Citizen Science Data	BIOSCIENCE			English	Article						citizen science; biodiversity; abundance; opportunities in citizen science; GBIF	CONSERVATION; TECHNOLOGIES; VALIDATION; ECOTOURISM; MODELS; BIAS	Citizen science is fundamentally shifting the future of biodiversity research. But although citizen science observations are contributing an increasingly large proportion of biodiversity data, they only feature in a relatively small percentage of research papers on biodiversity. We provide our perspective on three frontiers of citizen science research, areas that we feel to date have had minimal scientific exploration but that we believe deserve greater attention as they present substantial opportunities for the future of biodiversity research: sampling the undersampled, capitalizing on citizen science's unique ability to sample poorly sampled taxa and regions of the world, reducing taxonomic and spatial biases in global biodiversity data sets; estimating abundance and density in space and time, develop techniques to derive taxon-specific densities from presence or absence and presence-only data; and capitalizing on secondary data collection, moving beyond data on the occurrence of single species and gain further understanding of ecological interactions among species or habitats. The contribution of citizen science to understanding the important biodiversity questions of our time should be more fully realized.	[Callaghan, Corey T.; Mesaglio, Thomas; Rowley, Jodi J.

However, users have to use limited energy on the mobile devices as well as have to pay more communication fee when reporting sensory data to service providers. It is important to give them incentives to send information in participatory sensing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism for participatory sensing based on the evolutionary algorithm. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated by extensive simulations and its performance is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm successfully increases the number of participating users while it can also uniformly expand the coverage of a sensing area.

It involved a range stakeholders: funders of research (medical charities), service providers (the British Library), researchers and patients. Informed by practices within medical charities and the experiences of other citizen science projects, different methods were used to investigate trust, the skills required to produce a good lay summary, and the benefits of citizen science. A literature review into human factors was carried out and platforms for service delivery were analysed. The project was able to synthesise guidelines on participation in citizen science projects and the writing of lay summaries, and to identify challenges. This paper summarises the outcomes and lessons learned.

Goals and approaches in the use of citizen science for exploring plastic pollution in freshwater ecosystems: A review	FRESHWATER SCIENCE			English	Review						citizen science; plastic pollution; freshwater ecosystems; plastic-waste monitoring; natural resource management; citizen recruitment	ANTHROPOGENIC LITTER; MONITORING DATA; QUALITY; EDNA; MICROPLASTICS; MANAGEMENT; REVEAL; REMOTE; STREAM; SCALE	The role of citizen science in environmental monitoring has received interest in the research community over the last decade, with citizen scientists playing a key role in engaging with and gathering scientific evidence to support natural resource management. Likewise, the involvement of citizen science in aquatic research is growing. One area of aquatic research where there has been successful application of citizen science is in support of plastic-pollution research. Plastic-pollution research benefits from support by citizen scientists both because of the ubiquity of plastic within our environments, requiring data to be collected from a wide geographical area, and because of the need for systemic behavior change at both individual and societal levels. Recent studies highlight citizen science contributions to plastic-pollution research within marine systems, but our knowledge is limited about how citizen science can support limnetic plastic-pollution research, with no known published systematic reviews. The involvement of citizen science within freshwater monitoring has been widely discussed, but most peer-reviewed literature focuses on commonly targeted water-quality parameters (e.g., nutrients). This is not surprising given that freshwater plastic waste is a newly emerging field of interest; thus, the support of citizen science in this research area is only just beginning. This review is the 1(st) to explore the status of freshwater citizen science focused on plastic pollution. Based on a synthesis of 12 peer-reviewed publications, we considered the environmental and geographic extent of the research, research scope, methods, involvement of citizen science, and data quality. We also discuss how citizen science can contribute to emerging issues in freshwater science. Through our review we found that the use of citizen science within the field of freshwater plastic-pollution research remains rare, with most projects following the contributory model of citizen participation. Additionally, methods and standardized approaches for citizen recruitment, engagement, and training were limited in the peer-reviewed literature. Greater transparency of methods and approaches used will be key to opening up the potential for citizen science within this evolving research field. This review can be used as a starting point for researchers to develop their own freshwater plastic-waste monitoring programs involving citizen scientists.

This is logistically and financially challenging, especially for microplastics. Citizen science represents an option for sampling accessible sites to support long term monitoring, but challenges persist around data validation. Here we test a simple citizen science methodology to monitor visible microplastic contamination on sandy beaches using a standard quadrat unit (50 cm x 50 cm x 5 cm depth) sieved to 1 mm, to support the analysis of microplastic on two islands within the marine protected area of the Galapagos Archipelago, Ecuador (San Cristobal and Santa Cruz islands). High school and university students undertook supervised sampling of two beaches in 2019-2020 collecting over 7000 particles. A sub-sample of the suspected microplastics collected (n = 2,213, similar to 30% total) were analysed using FTIR spectrometry, confirming 93% of particles >1 mm visually identified by students were microplastics or rubber, validating this method as a crowd-sourced indicator for microplastic contamination. These data provide important insights into the plastic contamination of Galapagos, revealing plastic abundances of 0-2524 particles m(-2) over the two beaches (the highest reported in Galapagos). Strong accumulation gradients were measured parallel to the waterline at Punta Pitt (San Cristobal island) and perpendicular to the waterline at Tortuga Bay (Santa Cruz island), where four-fold higher concentrations were recorded at the sea turtle nesting habitat on the back-beach dune.

Its potential has also been recognized to contribute to the development of climate change education at earlier ages. This study aimed to investigate the perceptions of in-service teachers about the contribution of citizen science to climate change education. Seven teachers from 10 different elementary school classes participated in this study. Through a mixed methodology, data was collected using questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and participant observation. The results revealed that teachers recognized the potential of citizen science for their own pedagogical practice and students<acute accent> developed skills. This study reinforces the importance of teachers' involvement in citizen science projects. It also stresses the importance of incorporating citizen science projects with an investigative approach in the school context for students and teachers to develop skills.

Metrics of Efficiency and Performance when Using Evolutionary Algorithm on Desktop Grids	PROGRAMMING AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE			English	Article								The scope of volunteer computing systems is permanently expanding. The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is currently the most popular system for volunteer computing. There are many scientific papers devoted to adaptation of various computational algorithms to BOINC. The topic of this paper is the effective adaptation of the evolutionary algorithm to volunteer computing systems. We consider various causes of performance loss, as well as introduce some criteria and metrics for evaluating the performance of the algorithm. The proposed metrics can be used for comparative analysis of various job scheduling policies in the process of computation. The metrics can be evaluated during both actual and simulated computations.

The redundant-work distribution techniques are mainly used to exclude the malicious participants in the volunteer computing environment. However, the techniques cause some problems like delay of the work completion time or inefficiency of the work execution due to continuous requests of the work redistribution which arise from the reason that the techniques do not consider the characteristics of works and dynamic resources. To cope with such problems this paper suggests a regional matchmaking technique which can redistribute works in consideration of the characteristics of the works and the participant resources.

Citizen science and conservation: Recommendations for a rapidly moving field	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Biodiversity; Citizen science; Conservation; Public participation in scientific research	UNITED-STATES; SCIENTISTS; VOLUNTEERS; MANAGEMENT; ACCURACY; TOOL	Research taking place at the intersection of conservation and citizen science holds great potential for advancing both fields as well as for addressing grand challenges in the field of conservation. This Special Issue highlights the work of twenty research groups actively working at this intersection and examining participant motivation, learning and action; evaluating and improving research design and data quality; and investigating conservation science applications. The results of these studies directly contribute to advancing our understanding of the role that citizen science can play in conservation. As research continues in these fields, directing our efforts toward communicating insights, creating interdisciplinary teams that use citizen science to tackle wicked problems, and improving coordination among investments in citizen science are actions likely to have the greatest impact. We invite conservation and citizen science practitioners to contribute to the dialogues initiated by articles in this Special Issue. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Audible bats provide opportunities for citizen scientists	CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article						aural surveys; Bayesian hierarchical model; citizen science; echolocation; North American bat monitoring program (NABat); observation error; occupancy model; species distribution modeling	EUDERMA-MACULATUM; SPOTTED BAT; ECHOLOCATION CALLS; SPECIES OCCURRENCE; SCIENCE; BIODIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; CHIROPTERA; PATTERNS; MODELS	Bat conservation has been impeded by a lack of basic information about species' distributions and abundances. Public participation in closing this gap via citizen (community) science has been limited, but bat species that produce low-frequency calls audible to the unaided human ear provide an overlooked opportunity for collaborative citizen science surveys. Audible bats are rare in regional faunas but occur globally and can be under-surveyed by traditional methods. During 2019-2020, we were joined by community members to conduct aural surveys and expand our knowledge of rare audible desert bats in western North America through a structured survey design broadly adaptable for practitioners across the globe where audible bats occur. Our study was integrated into a statistically robust but flexible master sample in use by the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat), ensuring representativeness of data contributions. We used survey results to update a Bayesian species distribution model for the rare spotted bat, Euderma maculatum, accounting for imperfect detection and including land cover occupancy predictors. Detection probability was estimated similar to 0.7 +/- 0.1. Informative priors from a previous attempt to model E. maculatum were leveraged with the new citizen science data to support spatial predictions of occurrence previously impeded by data sparsity and which reinforced the biogeographic importance of arid cliffs and canyons. Our results are preliminary but encouraging, and future surveys can scale up through the NABat design structure and Bayesian modeling framework. We encourage future surveys to use recording devices to obtain voucher calls and double-observer methods to address false-positive detection errors that arise with inexperienced volunteers. Our design and model supported approach to integrating citizen science surveys into bat conservation programs can strengthen both the scientific understanding of rare species and public engagement in conservation practices.

Citizen science to support coastal research and management: Insights from a seagrass monitoring case study in Hainan, China	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Citizen science; Seagrass conservation; Environmental education; Public participation	CONSERVATION; MARINE; CHALLENGES; SCIENTISTS; VOLUNTEER; DEBRIS; TOOL	Citizen science has an active role in coastal and marine ecosystem monitoring, including seagrass beds. However, as yet the use of citizen science in the marine environment is limited. Moreover, there are very few studies analyzing and evaluating existing successful case studies, and the need for such work to fill vast information gaps is arguably great. This study evaluates a seagrass citizen science monitoring case study conducted on the Chinese island of Hainan from three perspectives: public participation, scientific impact, and social-ecological/economic impact. It also analyzes and assesses the role of civil society organizations in the implementation of citizen science projects for the first time. Our results challenge the dominant view of citizen science as a two-party relationship between academic researchers and volunteers. The evaluation shows that the impact of the proj-ect was limited in terms of the scientific and social/ecological dimensions. Yet, the results indicate that both, researchers and civil society, benefit from taking part in citizen science initiatives, as it provides a bridge to promote the collaboration between academic institutions and civil society organizations. Finally, drawing upon the lessons learned in this case study we outline general critical features of citizen science projects that support marine conservation practice and policy.

Biocultural Diversity Translated by Means of Technology and Language-The Case of Citizen Science Contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						translation; knowledge; citizen science; SDGs; knowledge management; knowledge co-production; knowledge transfer; biocultural diversity; terminology		Translation plays an important role in all areas of human activity. Despite its primary role of overcoming language barriers, it is used as an analogy for activities that require transfer, mediation, or negotiation of meaning. Knowledge translation is a concept that links knowledge to action, which is also at the heart of citizen science. Several studies have highlighted the ways in which citizen science can contribute to the definition, monitoring and implementation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although these studies emphasized the importance of data contributions for SDG reporting and monitoring purposes, this paper applies the concept of knowledge translation to citizen science for achieving the SDGs based on the conceptual framework provided by translation studies. Knowledge translation, citizen science, and the SDGs have their focus on actions and negotiations in common. Citizen science can, thus, be regarded as a mediator between science and the SDGs or a mediator between the public and policymakers. Exemplified by biocultural diversity, this paper analyzes the application of knowledge translation to the SDGs in and through citizen science. Citizen science guided by the SDGs requires different forms of knowledge ((and) translation) that are usable, accessible, and meaningful.

Online Community and Citizen Science supports environmental science learning by young people	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Community citizen science; Young people; Informal learning; Design features	AUTHENTIC SCIENCE; AGENCY	Community and citizen science in online settings could be seen as a means for young people to engage with and contribute to authentic science. Yet, there is a limited understanding of who takes part in citizen science among young people, what they learn, and through which processes, particularly in online settings. In this exploratory study, we analysed 34 in-depth interviews and log files of young people aged 11-19 years old who took part in citizen science projects, hosted on the Zooniverse platform. Data analysis suggested that participation in online citizen science can bring environmental science learning benefits to young people, with some participants reporting evidence of agency with science, highlighted by taking action to do science in another context. Many participating youth exhibited substantial previous science experiences that helped them to take part and learn from citizen science projects. Considering findings from this study, we present a first working framework of how environmental science learning is enabled or hindered by certain types of participation, as a means to guide the design of online citizen science for young people. We recommend that the future project design, publicity and recruitment in online citizen science activities explicitly target the needs and interests of young people with diverse characteristics and competencies to truly open science to all.

With the majority of Australia's population residing in large cities, this diverse potential pool of participants in science creates a significant opportunity to increase the spatial and temporal scale of research. Herein, we provide an overview of Australian urban citizen science projects based on an analysis of the projects listed in the Australian Citizen Science Association's Citizen Science Project Finder. We draw out key features (such as those with research questions specific to cities such as reintroduction and persistence of species in urban environments) from urban citizen science projects that make them suitable for the urban environment and use these features to suggest recommendations for further expansion and development of this important subset of projects. We conclude that the number and diversity of urban citizen science projects is relatively low in Australia, and advocate for an increase in initiatives that can tap into a large pool of potential participants for the benefit of science and society.

However, there are widely varying models of citizen science which may either challenge or reinforce existing knowledge paradigms and associated power dynamics. This paper explores different approaches to citizen science in the context of air quality monitoring in terms of their implications for environmental justice. This is achieved through a case study of air quality management in Dublin which focuses on the role of citizen science in this context. The evidence shows that the dominant interpretation of citizen science in Dublin is that it provides a means to promote awareness and behaviour change rather than to generate knowledge and inform new regulations or policies. This is linked to an overall context of technocratic governance and the exclusion of non-experts from decision-making. It is further closely linked to neoliberal governance imperatives to individualise responsibility and promote market-based solutions to environmental challenges. Last, the evidence highlights that this model of citizen science risks compounding inequalities by transferring responsibility and blame for air pollution to those who have limited resources to address it. Overall, the paper highlights the need for critical analysis of the implications of citizen science in different instances and for alternative models of citizen science whereby communities would contribute to setting objectives and determining how their data is used.

It can be seen as a win-win situation, where scientists get help from the public and the participants get a public engagement experience that involves them in real and meaningful scientific research. In this paper we present the results of a series of qualitative interviews with scientists who participated in the OPAL' portfolio of citizen science projects that has been running in England since 2007: What were their experiences of participating in citizen science? We highlight two particular sets of issues that our participants have voiced, methodological/epistemological and ethical issues. While we share the general enthusiasm over citizen science, we hope that the research in this paper opens up more debate over the potential pitfalls of citizen science as seen by the scientists themselves.

J	Golumbic, YN				Golumbic, Yaela N.			Where does the balance lie? Scientific, societal, and individual goals of citizen science projects	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Citizen science; Participatory research; Scientific development; Societal advancement; Individual and community benefit	MOTIVATIONS	Citizen science is growing rapidly with positive outcomes documented for ecological research, conservation, policy, innovation, and increased citizen stewardship. This rapid increase provides an opportunity to reflect on the characteristics of citizen science projects and determine their diverse goals, practices and outcomes. This paper focuses on the perspective of those initiating and leading citizen science projects in the third largest growing citizen science landscape - Australia, discussing the varying goals, outcomes and impacts. Findings from the statistical and thematic analysis of an online questionnaire (for multiple-choice and open-ended questions respectively), demonstrate the Australian citizen science landscape as growing exponentially, dominated by ecological and biodiversity projects, yet mostly local in scope and limited in numbers of participants. Individual and community goals such as education, raising awareness and public engagement, were found to be the focus of most citizen science projects, whilst scientific developments and policy advancement were often considered secondary goals. Projects leaders describe inherent tensions in managing projects and balancing their many goals. For example, public engagement was concurrently considered a benefit of citizen science enabling nonscientists participation in science discourse and research, and a challenge in recruitment, retention and ongoing communication with citizens scientists. The findings underscore the imperative of striking a balance between scientific rigor, policy objectives and societal aims, for advancing the vision of citizen science and maximizing its effectiveness and ecological impact. This relevance extends globally, urging nations from the Global North to the Global South, to consider replicating and adapting these approaches for broader societal benefit.

A Double machine learning trend model for citizen science data	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Causal Forests; causal inference; citizen science; confounding; Double machine learning; machine learning; propensity score; trends	INFERENCE; EBIRD	1. Citizen and community science datasets are typically collected using flexible protocols. These protocols enable large volumes of data to be collected globally every year; however, the consequence is that these protocols typically lack the structure necessary to maintain consistent sampling across years. This can result in complex and pronounced interannual changes in the observation process, which can complicate the estimation of population trends because population changes over time are confounded with changes in the observation process.2. Here we describe a novel modelling approach designed to estimate spatially explicit species population trends while controlling for the interannual confounding common in citizen science data. The approach is based on Double machine learn- ing, a statistical framework that uses machine learning (ML) methods to estimate population change and the propensity scores used to adjust for confounding dis- covered in the data. ML makes it possible to use large sets of features to control for confounding and to model spatial heterogeneity in trends. Additionally, we present a simulation method to identify and adjust for residual confounding missed by the propensity scores.3. To illustrate the approach, we estimated species trends using data from the citi- zen science project eBird. We used a simulation study to assess the ability of the method to estimate spatially varying trends when faced with realistic confounding and temporal correlation. Results demonstrated the ability to distinguish between spatially constant and spatially varying trends. There were low error rates on the estimated direction of population change (increasing/decreasing) at each location and high correlations on the estimated magnitude of population change.4. The ability to estimate spatially explicit trends while accounting for confounding inherent in citizen science data has the potential to fill important information gaps, helping to estimate population trends for species and/or regions lacking rigorous monitoring data.

J	Russell, MB; Desprez, J				Russell, Matthew B.; Desprez, Johanna			Assessing White-Tailed Deer Impacts to Tree Seedling Growth using Citizen Science Data in Minnesota, USA	FOREST SCIENCE			English	Article						community science; browse; wildlife; AVID; forest health	COST	White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) present numerous challenges for maintaining the health of forests in the US Lake States. Although many sources of data exist that provide coarse estimates of deer-browse impacts on plant survival and abundance (e.g., national forest inventories) or examine areas where deer are excluded (e.g., exclosures), few studies exist that use detailed tree seedling measurements across diverse stand conditions and forest types. This study evaluated four years of citizen science data collected in the Assessing Vegetation Impacts from Deer (AVID) program in Minnesota, USA. Results showed that average annual height growth of seedlings for nine browse-palatable species was 1.9 cm. For four of these tree species, annual height growth was not significantly different from zero. These results point to the challenges for the growth and survival of browse-palatable tree species in Minnesota under current deer population levels. Engaging the public through a citizen science project such as AVID showcases the importance of evaluating browse impacts on trees from white-tailed deer while simultaneously providing information to managers and decision makers about this important conservation concern. Study Implications: Citizen scientists can collect data on important conservation issues with ecological implications. This study showcases data provided by volunteers in Minnesota's Assessing Vegetation Impacts from Deer (AVID) program. These results showed that the growth of nine browse-palatable species grew minimally over a four-year span. Citizen science data like these can be used by state wildlife agencies to better understand forest-wildlife interactions and establish wildlife population harvest goals. Measurements of deer browse can also assist researchers by reducing the costs of data collection and providing a geographically diverse data set with detailed measurements of deer impacts to forest vegetation.

Citizen science in schools: Engaging students in research on urban habitat for pollinators	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						citizen science; pollinators; science education; science engagement; urban ecology	PARTICIPATION; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; INSECTS; PROJECT	Citizen science can play an important role in school science education. Citizen science is particularly relevant to addressing current societal environmental sustainability challenges, as it engages the students directly with environmental science and gives students an understanding of the scientific process. In addition, it allows students to observe local representations of global challenges. Here, we report a citizen science programme designed to engage school-age children in real-world scientific research. The programme used standardized methods deployed across multiple schools through scientist-school partnerships to engage students with an important conservation problem: habitat for pollinator insects in urban environments. Citizen science programmes such as the programme presented here can be used to enhance scientific literacy and skills. Provided key challenges to maintain data quality are met, this approach is a powerful way to contribute valuable citizen science data for understudied, but ecologically important study systems, particularly in urban environments across broad geographical areas.

J	Christine, DI; Thinyane, M				Christine, Debora Irene; Thinyane, Mamello			Citizen science as a data-based practice: A consideration of data justice	PATTERNS			English	Article							FLINT; WATER; MANAGEMENT; DETROIT; WEATHER	Citizen science has been motivated by several perspectives, including increased efficiency in data collection and distributed analysis, democratizing knowledge production, making science more responsive to community needs, and improving the representation of marginalized populations in public data. Despite the potential of citizen science to achieve social justice agendas through a data-intensive and data-driven participatory scientific enquiry, scholarship in critical data studies offers several problematizations of data-based practices, highlighting risks of exclusion and inequality. To understand the extent to which citizen science supports and challenges forms of injustice, this study used a "data justice" analytical framework to critically explore the assemblages of citizen science. We examined four citizen science cases with different levels of citizen engagement, intended outcomes, and data systems. The analysis suggests instances of injustice occurring throughout the data processes of the citizen science cases across the dimensions of procedural, instrumental, rights-based, structural, and distributive data justice.

J	Lewis, R; Carson, S				Lewis, Robert; Carson, Sally			Measuring Science Skills Development in New Zealand High School Students After Participation in Citizen Science Using a DEVISE Evaluation Scale	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Citizen science; DEVISE; Evaluation; STEM; New Zealand; Science capabilities		A goal of the New Zealand Curriculum is to equip students with the skills needed to use science critically and responsibly as citizens. One method of achieving this is through the participation in citizen science. Measuring the learning outcomes of citizen science experiences therefore, is important to ensure that development of science learning and understanding is occurring while meeting the goals of the science research. Many smaller citizen science projects are not able to develop their own evaluations due to the time and cost required to do so. The DEVISE set of citizen science evaluation instruments present a potential solution to this. Here we used the "DEVISE Skills of Science Inquiry" to measure science skill growth in high school students after participation in the citizen science project Shark Spy. Shark Spy is a collaborative citizen science project were participants take part in each step of the scientific process (introduction, methods, analysis, results, discussion) in collecting information on coastal shark species. Using the Skills of Science Inquiry participants reported that they had developed a better understanding of using science skills to observe, gather, interpret and discuss information. Owing to the structure of the evaluation it is possible to analyse skill development at different difficulty levels, as well as highlight areas of weakness within a citizen science project.

J	Füchslin, T; Schäfer, MS; Metag, J				Fuchslin, Tobias; Schafer, Mike S.; Metag, Julia			Who wants to be a citizen scientist? Identifying the potential of citizen science and target segments in Switzerland	PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE			English	Article						citizen science; science attitudes and perceptions; science communication; survey; Switzerland	COMMUNICATION; ATTITUDES; LITERACY	Driven by the proliferation of digital media, citizen science - the involvement of non-scientists in scientific research - represents one of the most important recent developments in science communication as it brings science and the public closer together. So far, however, citizen science projects have mostly attracted people that are highly educated, mostly male and already have very positive attitudes towards science. Based on nationally representative survey data (N = 1051), our study explores the potential of citizen science in Switzerland. Using regression analysis, we show that attitudes towards science are significant antecedents of respondents' interest in participating in citizen science - but that gender and education are not. In addition, latent class analysis identifies five segments, representing over one-third of the Swiss population, who are interested in citizen science and could potentially be engaged: 'Free-Timers', 'Senior Sciencephiles', 'Young Sciencephiles', 'Intrigued Adolescents' and 'Fully Employed Parents'. Additional description suggests that previously overlooked segments are best addressed online via YouTube or offline in zoos or botanical gardens. Overall, our analysis suggests that citizen science's potential is far higher than previous projects were able to realize.

Content is categorized into data and information: data is content stored in a database of a citizen science platform, while information is context-dependent content generated by users. Understanding data and information quality characteristics and utilizing them during design improves citizen science platforms' overall quality. This research investigates the integration of data and information quality characteristics into a citizen science platform for collecting information from the general public with no scientific training in the area where content is collected. The primary goal is to provide a framework for selecting and integrating data and information quality characteristics into the design for improving the content quality on platforms. The design and implementation of a citizen science platform that collects walking path conditions are presented, and the resulting implication is evaluated. The results show that the platform's content quality can be improved by introducing quality characteristics during the design stage of the citizen science platform.

In such an environment the resources are heterogeneous in terms of CPU speed, RAM, disk capacity, and network bandwidth. So finding a suitable resource to run a particular job becomes difficult. Resource discovery architecture is a key factor for overall performance of peer-to-peer based volunteer computing systems. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a proximity-aware resource discovery architecture for peer-to-peer based volunteer computing systems. The proposed resource discovery algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, it selects resources based on the requested quality of service and current load of peers. In the second stage, a resource with higher priority to communication delay is selected among the discovered resources. Communication delay between two peers is computed by a network model based on queuing theory, taking into account the background traffic of the Internet. Simulation results show that the proposed resource discovery algorithm improves the response time of user's requests by a factor of 4.04 under a moderate load. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we review existing security models for privacy-preserving participatory sensing and propose several improvements that are both of theoretical and practical significance. We first address an important drawback of prior work, namely the lack of consideration of collusion attacks that are highly relevant for such multiuser settings. We explain why existing security models are insufficient and why previous protocols become insecure in the presence of colluding parties. We remedy this problem by providing new security and privacy definitions that guarantee meaningful forms of collusion resistance. We propose new collusion-resistant participatory sensing protocols satisfying our definitions: a generic construction that uses anonymous identity-based encryption (IBE) and its practical instantiation based on the Boneh-Franklin IBE scheme. We then extend the functionality of participatory sensing by adding the ability to perform aggregation on the data submitted by the users, without sacrificing their privacy. We realize this through an additively-homomorphic IBE scheme which in turn is constructed by slightly modifying the Boneh-Franklin IBE scheme. From a practical point of view, the resulting scheme is suitable for calculations with small sensor readings/values such as temperature measurements, noise levels, or prices, which is sufficient for many applications of participatory sensing.

As a result, individuals are now creating and collecting more personal data than ever before. This offers an unprecedented chance for human-participant research ranging from the social sciences to precision medicine. With this potential wealth of data comes practical problems (e.g., how to merge data streams from various sources), as well as ethical problems (e.g., how best to balance risks and benefits when enabling personal data sharing by individuals). Results: To begin to address these problems in real time, we present Open Humans, a community-based platform that enables personal data collections across data streams, giving individuals more personal data access and control of sharing authorizations, and enabling academic research as well as patient-led projects. We showcase data streams that Open Humans combines (e.g., personal genetic data, wearable activity monitors, GPS location records, and continuous glucose monitor data), along with use cases of how the data facilitate various projects. Conclusions: Open Humans highlights how a community-centric ecosystem can be used to aggregate personal data from various sources, as well as how these data can be used by academic and citizen scientists through practical, iterative approaches to sharing that strive to balance considerations with participant autonomy, inclusion, and privacy.

Integrating humans into sensing systems has the potential to increase scale and reduce costs. However, contemporary participatory sensing software provides poor consideration of user dynamism, which includes: mobility across networks, mobility across devices and context-awareness. To address these limitations we propose the User Component and User Bindings. The former represents the user as a first class reconfigurable element of evolving and shared participatory sensing platforms. The latter allows the middleware to support multiple communications channels including Online Social Networks (OSN) to connect users with sensing applications. Our approach increases user participation, reduces out-of-context interactions and only consumes a limited amount of energy by sharing context information between applications. We support these claims by evaluating our approach on a two weeks experiment in which three participants take part in three concurrent participatory applications.

Our searches for "citizen science" and "energy" produced limited results and "citizen science" and "energy communities" produced zero. Therefore, to outline a future direction of citizen science, its potential alliances with energy communities, and their collaborative contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals, we performed a systematic literature review and analysis of "public participation" and "energy communities" using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRIMSA) guidelines. The results show four pathways through which current public participation in energy communities might be more explicitly aligned with citizen science projects: benefits and values, energy practices, intermediaries, and energy citizenship. Each of these pathways could engage citizen scientists in qualitative and quantitative research and increase scientific literacy about energy systems. Our call for citizen science to supplement current forms of participation builds from the "ecologies of participation" framework, itself an extension of co-productionist theories of science and technology studies. We conclude with a discussion of affordances and barriers to the alliances between citizen science and energy communities and their potential contributions to SDGs 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, 13: Climate Action, and 17: Partnerships for the Goals.

Although citizen science-generated data have enabled a number of research questions to be addressed, there is a growing interest in studying the process and outcomes of citizen science. The unifying focus of research on citizen science is the discovery of the socioscientific outcomes of expert-nonexpert partnerships that involve collecting authentic scientific data. Example areas of study include the modes of participant involvement, how identity in the context of authentic data may differ from that of informal science education, and factors of individual and community learning in the project context. On the basis of the unique development of theoretical ideas, we propose that research on citizen science should be acknowledged as a distinct discipline.

At each stage of this warning chain, relevant groups apply their expertise, but sharing information and transmission of data between groups is often imperfect. In diverse research fields, citizen science has been valuable in filling gaps through contributing local data. However, there is limited understanding of citizen science's role in bridging gaps in the warning value chain. Citizen science research projects could help improve the various aspects of the warning value chain by providing observations and evaluation, data verification and quality control, engagement and education on warnings, and improvement of accessibility for warnings. This paper explores the research question: How can citizen science contribute to the warning value chain? Two workshops were held with 29 experts on citizen science and the warning value chain to answer this question from a high impact weather perspective. The results from this study have shown that citizens, at individual or collective capacity, interact throughout the chain, and there are many prospects for citizen science projects for observations, weather, hazard, and impact forecasting, to warning communication and decision making. The study also revealed that data quality control is a main challenge for citizen science. Despite having limitations, the findings have shown that citizen science can be a platform for increasing awareness and creating a sense of community that adds value and helps bridge gaps in the warning value chain.

One of the challenges faced is the recruitment of participants by fully utilizing their daily activity behavior with self-adaptiveness toward the realistic application scenarios. In the paper, we propose a self-adaptive behavior-aware recruitment scheme for participatory sensing. People are assumed to join the sensing tasks along with their daily activity without pre-defined ground truth or any instructions. The scheme is proposed to model the tempo-spatial behavior and data quality rating to select participants for participatory sensing campaign. Based on this, the recruitment is formulated as a linear programming problem by considering tempo-spatial coverage, data quality, and budget. The scheme enables one to check and adjust the recruitment strategy adaptively according to application scenarios. The evaluations show that our scheme provides efficient sensing performance as stability, low-cost, tempo-spatial correlation and self-adaptiveness.

How to work with children and animals: A guide for school-based citizen science in wildlife research	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Review						citizen science; urban biodiversity; school students; environmental education; bird feeding	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; TOOL; STUDENTS	Engaging school students in wildlife research through citizen science projects can be a win-win for scientists and educators. Not only does it provide a way for scientists to gather new data, but it can also contribute to science education and help younger generations become more environmentally aware. However, wildlife research can be challenging in the best of circumstances, and there are few guidelines available to help scientists create successful citizen science projects for school students. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges faced when developing school-based citizen science projects in wildlife research by synthesising two sources of information. First, we conducted a small, school-based citizen science project that investigated the effects of supplementary feeding on urban birds as a case study. Second, we reviewed the literature to develop a database of school-based citizen science projects that address questions in wildlife ecology and conservation. Based on these activities, we present five lessons for scientists considering a school-based citizen science project. Overall, we found that school-based citizen science projects must be carefully designed to ensure reliable data are collected, students remain engaged, and the project is achievable under the logistical constraints presented by conducting wildlife research in a school environment. Ultimately, we conclude that school-based citizen science projects can be a powerful way of collecting wildlife data while also contributing to the education and development of environmentally aware students.

A Reputation Framework for Social Participatory Sensing Systems	MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Reputation framework; Trust; Participatory sensing; Online social networks; Data quality; Urban sensing; Fuzzy logic; Ranking algorithms	ISSUES	Social participatory sensing is a newly proposed paradigm that tries to address the limitations of participatory sensing by leveraging online social networks as an infrastructure. A critical issue in the success of this paradigm is to assure the trustworthiness of contributions provided by participants. In this paper, we propose an application-agnostic reputation framework for social participatory sensing systems. Our framework considers both the quality of contribution and the trustworthiness level of participant within the social network. These two aspects are then combined via a fuzzy inference system to arrive at a final trust rating for a contribution. A reputation score is also calculated for each participant as a resultant of the trust ratings assigned to him. We adopt the utilization of PageRank algorithm as the building block for our reputation module. Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in achieving high overall trust and assigning accurate reputation scores.

A Trust-based Recruitment Framework for Multi-hop Social Participatory Sensing	2013 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IN SENSOR SYSTEMS (IEEE DCOSS 2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCoSS)	MAY 21-23, 2013	Cambridge, MA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Assoc Comp Machinery		social participatory sensing; trust; online social networks; participatory sensing		The idea of social participatory sensing provides a substrate to benefit from friendship relations in recruiting a critical mass of participants willing to attend in a sensing campaign. However, the selection of suitable participants who are trustable and provide high quality contributions is challenging. In this paper, we propose a recruitment framework for social participatory sensing. Our framework leverages multi-hop friendship relations to identify and select suitable and trustworthy participants among friends or friends of friends, and finds the most trustable paths to them. The framework also includes a suggestion component which provides a cluster of suggested friends along with the path to them, which can be further used for recruitment or friendship establishment. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed recruitment framework in terms of selecting a large number of well-suited participants and providing contributions with high overall trust, in comparison with one-hop recruitment architecture.

Recent advancements in mobile device processing capabilities, combined with the energy efficiency of the mobile devices, make their inclusion in a distributed computing architecture particularly appealing. However, the intrinsic requirement of Internet connectivity to participate in volunteer computing limits the direct adoption of mobile devices due to service availability or related costs to connect to the Internet. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel computational architecture that extends the ability of mobile devices to participate in volunteer computing through ad hoc networking. By introducing decentralized task distribution points, mobile devices are invited to join the computation via device to device communication, removing the requirement for an Internet connection. Using a prototype implementation running on Android devices, we investigate the impact of a promising ad hoc communication technology, namely WiFi Direct, and two task distribution algorithms with different computation and communication overheads, under various scenarios. Experimental results show that our proposed approach is feasible with only minor additional energy consumption at the decentralized task distribution points.

By aggregating data sets from each participant, we can collect statistical information of the environment or phenomenona in the cloud. To promote use of participatory sensing in healthcare, research, and other useful applications, the protection of privacy is important to consider. The invasion of privacy in participatory sensing would have dire consequences because mobile phone used by these applications have sensitive data about users daily life. In this paper, we suggest a privacy-preserving participatory sensing scheme for real-world data sets with large numbers of categories by using Limited Negative Surveys. By using our method described in this paper, the server can reconstruct the probability distributions of the original distributions of sensed values without knowing the personal information of citizens. Furthermore, our research has the capablity to change, according to the features of data, especially the number of categories. We evaluate how this scheme of aggregate information can be still useful while protecting the privacy of users' original data.

It holds the promise of providing information that is otherwise challenging to access, which sets the stage for understanding and resolving various social issues. However, difficulties in engaging participants often hinder the fulfillment of this promise. The current paper presents a qualitative study in the context of dockless bikesharing, where participatory sensing constitutes a backbone of the bike status monitoring system. We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 participants. These participants came from different emergent groups who took part in filing status reports for shared bikes. Our analysis indicated close associations among participants' models of engagement, their perceived (dis)connections with the sensing data, and their situated interpretation of the incentives. Based on these findings, we propose ways to engage the commons in participatory sensing for dockless bikesharing and beyond.

In this paper, we present a participatory sensing based application called SenseDCity that discover travel pattern of the individual user, crowd flow of the city from the citizen's GPS trajectories. The system notifies users about the congestion, and current popular places near them. It takes the power of "people as a sensor" for identifying the road condition of the city, common health related symptoms among the citizen which in turn coming as a feedback and is a very valuable knowledge for both the citizen and the city administrator. The system is tested in the real-world scenarios and outcomes of the system are showing a glimpse of the huge potential of the proposed approach.

Volunteer computing has been used over the last few years in many other scientific fields and by CERN itself to run simulations of the LHC beams. The ATLAS@Home project was started to allow volunteers to run simulations of collisions in the ATLAS detector. So far many thousands of members of the public have signed up to contribute their spare CPU cycles for ATLAS, and there is potential for volunteer computing to provide a significant fraction of ATLAS computing resources. Here we describe the design of the project, the lessons learned so far and the future plans.

Community science-based monitoring reveals the role of land use scale in driving nearshore water quality in a large, shallow, Canadian lake. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. As shorelines and watersheds become increasingly developed, lake condition declines due to nutrient enrichment, excess algae growth, and contaminant loading. Lake Scugog, a large shallow lake in southern Ontario, Canada, is no exception, and has been experiencing increased urban development in its agriculture-dominated watershed over the last few decades. By applying a 3-pronged co-production model (stewardship group, watershed authority, and university laboratory), a nearshore water quality monitoring program was implemented using a community-science approach. Nearshore water samples were collected over 3 years (2017-2019) by trained community scientists. We found strong relationships between water quality parameters and land use, at the buffer and subcatchment scale. The strength of the land use relationships varied by parameter and scale, where chloride was significantly predicted by buffer land use, and phosphorus was explained by development at the subcatchment scale. Based on the high rate of participation compliance, the community science approach proved to be effective for capturing spatially explicit water quality data, which allowed us to establish current baseline conditions in Scugog's nearshore zone. Future watershed management should consider both scales of land use, but prioritize restoration efforts on the scale that corresponds to their specific water quality goals.

However, the issue of data quality has not been carefully addressed. Low quality data contributions may undermine the effectiveness and prospects of participatory sensing, and thus motivates the need for approaches to guarantee the high quality of the contributed data. In this paper, we integrate quality estimation and monetary incentive, and propose a quality-based surplus sharing method for participatory sensing. Specifically, we design an unsupervised learning approach to quantify the users' data qualities and long-term reputations, and exploit an outlier detection technique to filter out anomalous data items. Furthermore, we model the process of surplus sharing as a cooperative game, and propose a Shapley value-based method to determine each user's payment. We have conducted a participatory sensing experiment, and the experiment results show that our approach achieves good performance in terms of both quality estimation and surplus sharing.

We conducted focus groups targeting young people with and without citizen science experience. Qualitative findings identify a range of motivations including career development, new interests and knowledge, altruistic values, social interactions, inclusivity and connections to new places and nature. Several barriers were identified including logistical constraints, lack of knowledge and interest, programmatic and organisational issues. We discuss the implications of our findings to broaden the diversity of citizen scientists toward a younger demographic.

The emergence of the participatory sensing has resulted in a broad range of novel participatory sensing applications (PSA). PSA are more suitable to be developed by the people who want to launch the campaign, rather than the professional software developer. However, the development of PSA requires complex programming skill, and thus only professionals can build them. Inspired by the concept of end-user programming, this paper develops a tool, named PSAFactory, for non-professional people who do not understand the programming techniques to develop their own PSA in a quick and simple way. With this tool, non-professionals can build PSA by just doing some simple settings, while the tool will run automatically to tackle common issues in a completely transparent manner. Besides, two prototype applications are developed with the tool.

Aurorasaurus: A citizen science platform for viewing and reporting the aurora	SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						aurora; citizen science; alerts	VOLUNTEERS; EARTHQUAKE; TWITTER; MODEL	A new, citizen science-based, aurora observing and reporting platform has been developed with the primary aim of collecting auroral observations made by the general public to further improve the modeling of the aurora. In addition, the real-time ability of this platform facilitates the combination of citizen science observations with auroral oval models to improve auroral visibility nowcasting. Aurorasaurus provides easily understandable aurora information, basic gamification, and real-time location-based notification of verified aurora activity to engage citizen scientists. The Aurorasaurus project is one of only a handful of space weather citizen science projects and can provide useful results for the space weather and citizen science communities. Early results are promising with over 2000 registered users submitting over 1000 aurora observations and verifying over 1700 aurora sightings posted on Twitter.	[MacDonald, E. A.; Case, N.

A critical challenge for participatory sensing is how to preserve the privacy of individual contributors' data. In addition, the integrity of the data aggregation is vital to ensure the acceptance of the participating sensing model by the participants. Existing approaches to these issues suffer from excessive communication cost, long delays or rely on a trusted third party. The objective of our research is to design a data-aggregation scheme for participatory sensing systems that addresses user privacy and data integrity while keeping communication overhead as low as possible. We propose four techniques to address these challenges and validate them through analytical models and simulations.

In our previous work, we have implemented a prototype system of parallel VC with the approach of server assisted communication and demonstrated the feasibility of parallel computing on a VC environment, not distributed computing as in the current VC. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of parallel VC. The nature of nodes' volatility and unreliability in VC makes parallel computing not always effective. Through the simulations using open trace data of nodes' behavior, we reveal parallelism and redundancy of job execution which minimize execution time while maintaining high degree of reliability.

Aese projects allow people to solve problems that were previously too computationally intensive to solve. However, due to the relatively small fraction of the population that participates in volunteer computing projects, it's very important to use the donated CPU cycles as efficiently as possible. Volunteer computing clients use two different methods to retrieve tasks: retrieving one task at a time when the client has no more work to do or retrieving multiple tasks at once and storing them in a buffer. We simulate these different task retrieval policies to compare the number of tasks completed by clients using the different policies. Our simulations showed that clients that retrieve one task at a time complete more tasks than clients that retrieve multiple tasks at once and buffer them. Our simulations also showed that there was not a significant gain in the amount of work that could be completed by devising a more complicated adaptive policy.

Environmental and user-centric sensor data of unprecedented quantity and quality can be captured and reported by a possible user base of billions of mobile phone subscribers worldwide. The strong focus on the collection of detailed sensor data may however compromise user privacy in various regards, e.g., by tracking a user's current location. In this survey, we identify the sensing modalities used in current participatory sensing applications, and assess the threats to user privacy when personal information is sensed and disclosed. We outline how privacy aspects are addressed in existing sensing applications, and determine the adequacy of the solutions under real-world conditions. Finally, we present countermeasures from related research fields, and discuss their applicability in participatory sensing scenarios. Based on our findings, we identify open issues and outline possible solutions to guarantee user privacy in participatory sensing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Extensive biogeochemical monitoring that can assess local acidification conditions, distinguish multiple drivers of changing carbonate chemistry, and ultimately inform local and regional response strategies is necessary for successful adaptation to OCA. However, the sampling frequency and cost-prohibitive scientific equipment needed to monitor OCA are barriers to implementing the widespread monitoring of dynamic coastal conditions. Here, we demonstrate through a case study that existing community-based water monitoring initiatives can help address these challenges and contribute to OCA science. We document how iterative, sequential outreach, workshop-based training, and coordinated monitoring activities through the Northeast Coastal Acidification Network (a) assessed the capacity of northeastern United States community science programs and (b) engaged community science programs productively with OCA monitoring efforts. Our results (along with the companion manuscript) indicate that community science programs are capable of collecting robust scientific information pertinent to OCA and are positioned to monitor in locations that would critically expand the coverage of current OCA research. Furthermore, engaging community stakeholders in OCA science and outreach enabled a platform for dialogue about OCA among other interrelated environmental concerns and fostered a series of co-benefits relating to public participation in resource and risk management. Activities in support of community science monitoring have an impact not only by increasing local understanding of OCA but also by promoting public education and community participation in potential adaptation measures.

Consequently, citizen science is of increasing importance for large scale data collection. In this study, we described the range boundaries of the four Hynobius species occurring in Korea based on genetic identification and refined their distribution through citizen science data. The genetic identification of individuals was extracted from the literature, while the citizen science data were extracted from iNaturalist through GBIF. Distribution boundary lines were drawn from the genetic data and consistency with citizen science datapoints was assessed through a comparative analysis with the points found beyond the established boundary lines. Depending on the species, 1.43 to 25.00% of the observations extracted from the citizen science data were located beyond the boundaries suggested by the molecular analyses, with average distances ranging from 3.51 +/- 2.97 to 51.47 +/- 30.87 km (mean +/- SD). We considered these variations negligible in the view of the whole distribution of these species. In general, the distributions extracted from iNaturalist were accurate and adequately representative of the distribution of the species, with the exception of the recently split H. quelpaertensis. Additionally, citizen science data highlighted the absence of gaps in the distribution of these species. In conclusion, given the good accuracy of citizen science data, we recommend the publication of molecular based data so that citizen science platforms could help define accurately the range of species for which data is missing or outdated.

The modern Forel-Ule scale: a 'do-it-yourself' colour comparator for water monitoring	JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN OPTICAL SOCIETY-RAPID PUBLICATIONS			English	Article						Forel-Ule scale; water quality; participatory science; ocean colour; colourimetry; citizen science; water monitoring	NATURAL-WATERS; LAKE WATER; CLARITY; MERCURY	The colour comparator Forel-Ule scale has been used to estimate the colour of natural waters since the 19th century, resulting in one of the longest oceanographic data series. This colour index has been proven by previous research to be related to water quality indicators such as chlorophyll and coloured dissolved organic material. The aim of this study was to develop an affordable, 'Do-it-Yourself' colour scale that matched the colours of the original Forel-Ule scale, to be used in water quality monitoring programs by citizens. This scale can be manufactured with high-quality lighting filters and a white frame, an improvement with respect to the materials employed to manufacture the original scale from the 19th century, which required the mixing of noxious chemicals. The colours of the new scale were matched to the original colours using instrumental and visual measurements carried out under controlled lighting conditions, following the standard measurement protocols for colour. Moreover, the colours of the scale are expressed in Munsell notations, a standard colour system already successfully used in water quality monitoring. With the creation of this Modern Forel-Ule scale, as a 'Do-it-yourself' kit, the authors foresee a possible use of the Forel-Ule number as a water quality index that could be estimated by means of participatory science and used by environmental agencies in monitoring programs.

Participatory science for coastal water quality: freshwater plume mapping and volunteer retention in a randomized informational intervention	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS			English	Article							CITIZEN SCIENCE; INDICATOR BACTERIA; MOTIVATIONS; CONTAMINATION; IMPROVE; IMPACT	Among the biggest threats to coastal water quality are freshwater discharges. It is difficult to predict the spatial extent of freshwater plumes at marine beaches because processes governing mass transport in the surf zone are complex. Participatory science approaches could facilitate collecting shoreline data, although volunteer sampling campaigns can be challenged by data quality and volunteer retention. The goals of this study were to (1) work with volunteers to estimate safe swimming distances at beaches that receive polluted discharges, and (2) test whether informational feedback to volunteers increased retention. Forty-six volunteers participated over 12 weeks in 2019 by collecting 1452 salinity measurements at beaches near the mouths of two Central California freshwater discharges and completing participation surveys. These measurements resulted in 145 distinct estimates of safe swimming distances (D-90), spanning a range of environmental conditions during rainy and dry periods. MedianD(90)s were 150 and 100 m at San Pedro Creek south and north, and 490 and 330 m at San Lorenzo River west and east, respectively.D(90)was significantly associated with adjacent freshwater discharge rate at both discharges and tide level at one discharge. On average, the odds of volunteers conducting sampling decreased by 4% (95% CI: 1%, 7%) with each successive week. A randomized intervention providing repeated data feedbackviaemail to volunteers did not affect their retention in the study.

Methods and Results Using a co-created community science methodology, between 2017 and 2020, a total of 587 harvested rainwater samples and 147 garden soil samples irrigated with harvested rainwater were collected from four Arizona communities and analyzed for coliform, Escherichia coli, and/or Salmonella. Participants also completed a home description survey regarding their home and surrounding area, water harvesting infrastructure, and gardening habits. Conclusion Chi-Square tests revealed that the quality of harvested rainwater is affected by proximity to a waste disposal or incineration facility, animal presence, cistern treatment, and cistern age (P < 0.05), while soil samples were associated with community (P < 0.05). Coliform and E. coli concentrations in both sample types were greater in the monsoon season.	[Moses, Arthur; Ramirez-Andreotta, Monica D.; McLain, Jean E.

Entomological citizen science in Canada	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article							MONITORING DATA; BOMBUS; TOOL; PARTICIPATION; VOLUNTEERS; DECLINE	Citizen science involves voluntary participation in the scientific process, typically by gathering data in order to monitor some aspect of the natural world. Entomological citizen science, as an extension of traditional amateur entomology, is an active field in Canada, with online databases such as eButterfly and BugGuide attracting both contributors and database users. As well, traditional amateur entomology continues to be important in Canada, as do short-term insect-themed educational events, the involvement of amateurs in entomological societies, and online crowdsourcing initiatives. Success of citizen science projects can be measured in many ways. In terms of published papers that analyse trends in citizen science data, Canadian projects have only begun to deliver. More valuable are particular records that improve our knowledge of geographic ranges and phenology. In terms of the endurance of particular projects, and the willingness of volunteers to participate, citizen science entomology in Canada is clearly a success. However, quality control of citizen science data remains an issue for some projects. As well, challenges remain with respect to balancing the goals of researchers, participants, and supporting institutions.

INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Citizen science; School-based citizen science; Teacher-scientist partnerships; Mutualistic partnerships	RESEARCH-PRACTICE PARTNERSHIPS; TASK VALUES; SCIENTISTS; EDUCATION; BELIEFS; ENGAGEMENT; MOTIVATION; IDENTITY; AGENCY	In a typical citizen science scenario different groups of people take on various roles in a research process that is often coupled with educational, social or personal objectives. A widely accepted viewpoint asserts that such an endeavor should bring benefits to all involved parties and that no participating individuals should act in service of others or of the end goal. However, the large variety of implementation models, of participating individuals, and of desired impacts, leaves room for inconsistencies regarding what outcomes count towards mutual benefits. In this article we examine the ambiguity embedded in the definition of mutual benefits in citizen science and take a stand towards its resolution. We use school-based citizen science as a model for a multi-stakeholder, multi-objective citizen science. Focusing on teachers and scientists that work together to facilitate student participation in citizen science, nine teacher-scientist pairs that collaborated on nine different school-based projects were included as study participants. We examined participants' motivations for school-based citizen science and perceived costs and benefits using a questionnaire that they filled while verbally explaining their answers. Our findings reveal multiple ways in which teachers and scientists tapped into their professional, social and personal identities to create multilayered sets of motivations and perceptions of benefits. Thus, we argue that a mutualistic perspective of citizen science should take this complexity into account and be prepared to answer multi-faceted expectations, which may reside not just among but also within participating individuals.

Although new measurement tools such as low-cost sensors make local data more accessible, a better understanding of gaps in regional datasets is needed to develop effective metropolitan-scale solutions. Using scoping review methodology, we compiled 214 published journal articles and grey literature reports of air quality data from the Detroit, Michigan area from 1952 through 2020. This critical scoping review focuses on air quality datasets, but related topics such as health studies and communitybased participatory science studies were examined from the included articles. Most of these publications were peerreviewed journal articles published after 2001. Particulate matter, nitrous oxides, and sulfur dioxide were the most commonly studied air pollutants, and asthma was the most frequently associated health outcome paired with air pollution datasets. Few publications reported methods for community-based participatory science. This critical scoping review establishes a foundation of historical air quality data for the Detroit metropolitan area and a set of evaluation criteria that can be replicated in other urban centers. This foundation enables future detailed analysis of air quality datasets and showcases strategies for implementing effective community science programs and monitoring efforts.

Citizen science is advantageous for collecting large amounts of scientific data and can be seen as a crowdsourcing approach to data collection. Information and communications technology is enhancing the availability of citizen science. Mobile devices, such as mobile phones, that have a digital camera with a global positioning system (GPS) are necessities for contemporary life and can be utilised as powerful observation tools in citizen science. New information A web-based system has been developed as a data collection tool for citizen science. Participants submit an e-mail with a photo taken by their mobile phones. The photos contain location information, which can be easily and automatically embedded if the mobile phone is equipped with GPS. Collaboration has been undertaken with regional event managers, such as museum curators and held citizen science events in each region and for various target taxonomic groups. All photos were stored in the data server and the organisms were taxonomically identified by citizen scientists, regional managers and the authors. In total, 154 species and 843 data records were collected in this project conducted from 2011 to 2016.

Our main objective is to construct a computational framework that applies to the optimum design problem of prairies. This ecology problem is characterized by a large parameter set, noisy multi-objective functions, and the presence of multiple local optima that reflects biodiversity. Our approach consists in enhancing the iterative (synchronous) master-worker genetic algorithm to overcome the limitations of volatile and unreliable distributed computing resources considering a sufficiently large number of volunteer computers. Though volunteer computing is known to be much less performing than parallel environments such as clusters and grids, our GA solution turns to exhibit competitive performance.

The aim is to identify the problems and opportunities for attracting young people to Citizen Science using an example of genetic research projects held in 2020-2023 in Russia. The paper briefly reviews the development of the understanding and use of Citizen Science, as well as shows its application in genetic research. Empirical data were obtained in the course of qualitative and mass quantitative sociological studies. Scientific, organizational, and social contexts of wide involvement of people in scientific activity are shown. The narratives and motives of interested parties are analyzed. The study revealed limited development of Citizen Science practices in Russia, as well as the underdevelopment of the infrastructure for expanding social participation in scientific research. Moreover, natural scientists show contradictory attitudes and doubts about the involving volunteers in scientific research. We conclude that critical and doubtful attitudes towards Citizen Science decrease as practical experience of interaction is gained. According to data from mass sociological studies, there are significant differences in young people's assessments of scientific activity and participation in volunteer practices, especially at school age. The necessity to draw public attention to the potential of using Citizen Science in a broad sense has been demonstrated.

Citizen science makes science accessible to the public and promotes public trust. Since there is scarce evidence about attitudes toward citizen science in the field of biomedicine, we aimed to evaluate the attitudes, motivations, and concerns of the Latvian general population and scientists from the biomedical research field toward citizen science research projects. We developed a survey that consisted of seven different citizen science research project examples (vignettes) and circulated it among the Latvian general population and researchers online, collecting quantitative and qualitative data. In total 314 individuals from the general population and 49 researchers filled in the survey. After the analysis was performed, we concluded that the general population and biomedical scientists in Latvia have different expectations toward citizen science. The results showed that while the general public is more interested in individual and societal benefits and concerned with specific participation aspects like filming, photographing, or co-funding, the scientists see the biggest potential contribution to their project in aspects of additional data collection and potential financial support, and are concerned about data quality, potential legal issues, and additional coordination communication that would be needed.

Every day thousands of ordinary citizens are engaging in data collection and data processing, giving rise to the new field of citizen science. Never before has the technology enabled scientists to reach out to such vast numbers of collaborators and show their work to the public. From pattern recognition in Hubble space telescope images of distant galaxies to field observations of migration patterns of birds in the rural areas of United States, the possibilities are countless. Certainly this new trend poses important problems and challenges, but it is also obvious that wide acceptance of citizen science can lead not only to great scientific results, but to the popularization of scientific method among the public. In the paper we examine the current state of citizen science, we outline some of the most interesting and difficult challenges in leading scientific projects on such scale, and we present typologies of citizen science projects. We also provide a survey of ICT tools available for citizen science projects.

But what would be the basis for such an alignment? Could it offer important reciprocal benefits for Citizen Science? We address our first question by conducting a systematic comparison of Community Operational Research and Citizen Science to reveal points of commonality and difference between the two. Having established the basis for alignment, we then address our second question by exploring how alignment might be realised at micro, meso and macro levels. Through this exploration, we highlight opportunities for Community Operational Research to avail itself of Citizen Science's proximity to policy makers, and we make available to Citizen Science some approaches from Community Operational Research for structuring issues and dealing with contestable knowledge claims.

We present contributory citizen science as a valuable method to scientists and practitioners within the environmental and ecological sciences, focusing on the full life cycle of citizen science practice, from design to implementation, evaluation and data management. We highlight key issues in citizen science and how to address them, such as participant engagement and retention, data quality assurance and bias correction, as well as ethical considerations regarding data sharing. We also provide a range of examples to illustrate the diversity of applications, from biodiversity research and land cover assessment to forest health monitoring and marine pollution. The aspects of reproducibility and data sharing are considered, placing citizen science within an encompassing open science perspective.

In order to maximize the effectiveness of citizen science projects, the motivations of these volunteers should be understood as they initially draw volunteers into the project and encourage continued engagement. Through detailed interviews with 30 participants in an online astronomy citizen science project, we categorise initial motivating factors into intrinsic and extrinsic factors and reasons for ending participation into external and internal factors. We find that volunteers with more frequent engagement in citizen science tasks are more intrinsically motivated than those who participate less frequently. Our findings that infrequent visitors, who as a whole make a significant contribution to citizen science projects, are often extrinsically motivated reveals a need for both intrinsic and extrinsic motivating factors to be built into a project and project communications in order to diversify the pool of volunteers and to maximise participation. In addition, we report on factors that led to citizen scientists stopping their engagement with a project over the short and long term.

Citizen science as a vehicle to address multiple policy objectives: Case studies from Australia	HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA			English	Article						chronic disease prevention; citizen science; community involvement; health promotion; public policy		Issue AddressedDespite increasing interest in citizen science as an approach to engage members of the public in research and decision making about health and wellbeing, there is a lack of practical evidence to guide policy and practice organisations to utilise these approaches. In this study we investigated how and why citizen science came to be incorporated into the work of two policy organisations.MethodsWe offer two in-depth case studies of Australian government organisations which have utilised citizen science in environmental and healthy ageing policy. Interviews with organisational informants and relevant documents were analysed inductively to explore how citizen science came to be adopted, legitimised and supported.ResultsCitizen science was utilised to address multiple organisational objectives, including increasing community participation in science; enhancing individuals' wellbeing, learning, and skills, and generating data to support research and policy in a relatively cost-effective manner. In both cases, grant funding was a mechanism to support citizen science, with project delivery facilitated through academic-policy partnerships and led by external academic or community partners.ConclusionAlthough citizen science is relatively new in policy and practice settings, this study underscores the value of these approaches in realising co-benefits for organisations, academics, and community members. The support and advocacy of senior managers as 'champions', and a willingness to invest in trialling new approaches to address policy problems are necessary ingredients to foster acceptance and legitimacy of citizen science.So What?Citizen science initiatives can be strategically utilised by health promotion organisations to enact priorities related to genuine community involvement, support research and innovation and facilitate collaboration and partnerships between academic, policy and community stakeholders.

ANIMALS			English	Article						citizen science; citizen science guidelines; koala management	CONSERVATION; QUEENSLAND; MANAGEMENT; BIODIVERSITY; VALIDATION; VOLUNTEERS; PATTERNS; TOOL	The acceptance and application of citizen science has risen over the last 10 years, with this rise likely attributed to an increase in public awareness surrounding anthropogenic impacts affecting urban ecosystems. Citizen science projects have the potential to expand upon data collected by specialist researchers as they are able to gain access to previously unattainable information, consequently increasing the likelihood of an effective management program. The primary objective of this research was to develop guidelines for a successful regional-scale citizen science project following a critical analysis of 12 existing citizen science case studies. Secondly, the effectiveness of these guidelines was measured through the implementation of a citizen science project, Koala Quest, for the purpose of estimating the presence of koalas in a fragmented landscape. Consequently, this research aimed to determine whether citizen-collected data can augment traditional science research methods, by comparing and contrasting the abundance of koala sightings gathered by citizen scientists and professional researchers. Based upon the guidelines developed, Koala Quest methodologies were designed, the study conducted, and the efficacy of the project assessed. To combat the high variability of estimated koala populations due to differences in counting techniques, a national monitoring and evaluation program is required, in addition to a standardised method for conducting koala population estimates. Citizen science is a useful method for monitoring animals such as the koala, which are sparsely distributed throughout a vast geographical area, as the large numbers of volunteers recruited by a citizen science project are capable of monitoring a similarly broad spatial range.

J	Groot, B; Abma, T				Groot, Barbara; Abma, Tineke			Ethics framework for citizen science and public and patient participation in research	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						Research ethics; Ethics framework; Ethics work; Citizen science; Patient and public engagement; Medical Research Ethics Committee	HEALTH RESEARCH; CARE	Background Citizen science and models for public participation in health research share normative ideals of participation, inclusion, and public and patient engagement. Academic researchers collaborate in research with members of the public involved in an issue, maximizing all involved assets, competencies, and knowledge. In citizen science new ethical issues arise, such as who decides, who participates, who is excluded, what it means to share power equally, or whose knowledge counts. This article aims to present an ethics framework that offers a lens of understanding and heuristic guidelines to deal with ethical issues in citizen science. Methods We conducted seven case studies between 2015 and 2021 to attune and validate the ethics framework for the context of citizen science. The cases related to studies with older adults, people with a psychiatric vulnerability, people dependent on community care, people who are unemployed or living in poverty or both, and young adults with respiratory disease. Results Ethics in citizen science reaches beyond the ethical issues in traditional biomedical and health research. It entails more than following procedures about informed consent and privacy and submitting a proposal to a Medical Research Ethics Committee. Ethics in citizen science relates to everyday ethical issues during the study, including relational and moral complexities concerning collaboration, sharing power, and democratic decision-making. Dealing with these issues requires ethics work of researchers. This entails seeing ethically salient issues and reflecting on everyday ethical issues. Ethics work consists of seven features: framing work, role work, emotion work, identity work, reason work, relationship work, and performance work. All are relevant for researchers in citizen science. Conclusions Ethical issues in citizen science often relate to power differentials, partnership, and collaboration between academics and non-academics. The ethics framework prepares researchers for the work needed in citizen science to act responsibly and offers a heuristic guide to reflect on ethics. Reflection on ethics is a pathway towards ethical citizen science, especially if researchers collaboratively reflect in partnership with non-academics who are subject to the moral issue.

By gaining an understanding of forms of engagement, reasons for ongoing participation, and the impact of project design on participant motivation and engagement, we can help keep people involved in such projects. We address these issues by investigating motivational drivers and forms of engagement among volunteers in an ecological citizen science project. Our mixed-method approach involved interviews conducted with 26 core participants and questionnaires completed by 89 participants. Our analyses reveal an array of motivational drivers and various forms of engagement. While seeking to contribute to nature conservation was an important motivation for joining the project, the primary driver for ongoing participation was learning through social interactions. Moreover, the citizen science project design influenced participants' motivation and engagement.

However, citizen science data come with uncertainty as they are provided by the general public. In order to investigate this uncertainty, a decision tree methodology was applied to evaluate existing citizen science data of stream stage based on the CrowdHydrology (CH) network. Quality control (QC) flags were developed and applied to CH sites, dividing Level 1 dataset (raw dataset) into Level 2 (flagged dataset) and Level 3 (processed dataset). Error estimates were calculated to determine uncertainty in the citizen science data. The results indicate that the decision tree could provide reliable QC for citizen science data and demonstrate how uncertainty can be quantified in the QC datasets.

Branding the MEGA lab; methods to improve science communication and citizen science engagement	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						MEGA lab; science branding; SciComm; citizen science; science communication; science marketing	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK; TOOL	The MEGA Lab uses branding and marketing techniques as a complementary form of science communication to improve citizen science. Storytelling, inclusivity, personalization, digital marketing, and collaborations are key components to brand marketing. Through branding, science projects within the MEGA Lab have increased their visibility, attracted more participants, and enhanced credibility. In addition, the MEGA Lab branding can also help citizen science projects to reach a wider audience. By promoting the MEGA Lab brand through social media, outreach events, and other channels, citizen science projects can increase inclusivity by attracting more participants who are interested in contributing to scientific research. We believe that other science research programs and citizen science projects can benefit from branding as a complementary form of science communication. By improving science communication, it is proposed that targeted citizen science projects can improve their visibility, credibility, and impact. This can lead to more effective and valuable contributions to scientific research, as well as a greater understanding and appreciation of science among the general public.

Citizen science data accurately predicts expert-derived species richness at a continental scale when sampling thresholds are met	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Citizen science; Species richness; Frogs; Anurans; FrogID	BIODIVERSITY; PATTERNS; FROGS; DETECTABILITY; DIVERSITY; HABITAT; SPACE; ANURA; TIME; BIAS	Understanding species richness patterns in time and space is critical for conservation management and ecological analyses. But estimates of species richness for a given place are often imprecise and incomplete, even when derived from expert-validated range maps. The current uptake of citizen science in natural resource management, conservation, and ecology offers great potential for extensive data to define species occurrence and richness patterns in the future. Yet, studies are needed to validate these richness patterns and ensure these data are fit-for-purpose. We compared data from a continental-scale citizen science project-FrogID-with expert-derived range maps to assess how well the former predicts species richness patterns in space. We then investigated how many citizen science submissions are necessary to fully sample the underlying frog community. There was a strong positive association between citizen science species richness estimates and estimates derived from an expert-derived map of frog distributions. An average of 153 citizen science submissions were necessary to fully-sample frog richness based on the expert-derived frog richness. Sampling effort in the citizen science project was negatively correlated with the remoteness of an area: less remote areas were more likely to have a greater number of citizen science submissions and be fully sampled. This suggests that scientists will likely need to rely on professionals for data collection in remote regions. We conclude that a citizen science project that has been running for similar to 18 months, can accurately predict frog species richness at a continental scale compared with an expert-derived map based on similar to 240 years of data accumulation. At large-scales, biodiversity data derived from citizen science projects will likely play a prominent role in the future of biodiversity and conservation.	[Callaghan, Corey T.; Rowley, Jodi J.

These online citizen science projects are frequently lauded for their potential to revolutionize the scope and scale of data collection and analysis, improve scientific literacy, and democratize science. Yet, despite the attention online citizen science has attracted, it remains unclear how widespread public participation is, how it has changed over time, and how it is geographically distributed. Importantly, the demographic profile of citizen science participants remains uncertain, and thus to what extent their contributions are helping to democratize science. Here, we present the largest quantitative study of participation in citizen science based on online accounts of more than 14 million participants over two decades. We find that the trend of broad rapid growth in online citizen science participation observed in the early 2000s has since diverged by mode of participation, with consistent growth observed in nature sensing, but a decline seen in crowdsourcing and distributed computing. Most citizen science projects, except for nature sensing, are heavily dominated by men, and the vast majority of participants, male and female, have a background in science. The analysis we present here provides, for the first time, a robust 'baseline' to describe global trends in online citizen science participation. These results highlight current challenges and the future potential of citizen science. Beyond presenting our analysis of the collated data, our work identifies multiple metrics for robust examination of public participation in science and, more generally, online crowds. It also points to the limits of quantitative studies in capturing the personal, societal, and historical significance of citizen science.

J	Quinn, A				Quinn, Aleta			Transparency and secrecy in citizen science: Lessons from herping	STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE			English	Article						Citizen science; Transparency; Epistemic communities; Herpetology; Big data; Practice	EUBLEPHARIDAE; KNOWLEDGE	In this paper I will outline a worry that citizen science can promote a kind of transparency that is harmful. I argue for the value of secrecy in citizen science. My argument will consist of analysis of a particular community (herpers), a particular citizen science platform (iNaturalist, drawing contrasts with other platforms), and my own travels in citizen science. I aim to avoid a simple distinction between science versus non-science, and instead analyze herping as a rich practice [MacIntyre, 2007]. Herping exemplifies citizen science as functioning simultaneously within and outside the sphere of science. I show that herpers have developed communal systems of transmitting and protecting knowledge. Ethical concerns about secrecy are inherently linked to these systems of knowledge. My over-arching aim is to urge caution in the drive to transparency, as the concepts of transparency and secrecy merit close scrutiny. The concerns I raise are complementary to those suggested by previous philosophical work, and (I argue) resist straightforward solutions. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Through a case study of amateur entomology in Finland, the paper discusses amateurs' diverse motivations for engaging with nature. The paper discusses especially the affective and ethical aspects of amateur entomology and its implications for citizen science. The discussion is based on an ethnographic study of an entomologist society. The paper suggests that amateur naturalism cannot be reduced to any single definition of citizen science, but amateur entomologists enact different epistemologies as knowledge producers and active citizens. The amateurs are often motivated by an ethical 'first contract' with nature. The rich amateur culture may democratize and 're-enchant' science, provided the scientist worldview of superior data is not allowed to conceal the diversity of amateur motivations.

In fact, the most successful and mature projects study species movements or behaviour patterns through spatio-temporal observations. However, the use of these data is difficult in some scenarios due to the heterogeneity of the sources and the lack of consensus on how to share them across different scientific communities. This work focuses on defining a DCAT profile for citizen science based on PPSR Core to promote consistency and interoperability with other DCAT-based systems, such as data repositories and search engines. This can facilitate the discovery, sharing and reuse of citizen science data across different life science projects.

Undoubtedly, without tactile Internet and secure VC ecosystems, harnessing its full potentials and making it an alternative viable and reliable computing infrastructure is next to impossible. Android-enabled smart devices, applications, and services are inevitable for Volunteer computing. Contrarily, the progressive developments of sophisticated Android malware may reduce its exponential growth. Besides, Android malwares are considered the most potential and persistent cyber threat to mobile VC systems. To secure Android-based mobile volunteer computing, the authors proposedMulDroid, an efficient and self-learning autonomous hybrid (Long-Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Neural Network) multi-vector Androidmalware threat detection framework. The proposed mechanism is highly scalable with well-coordinated infrastructure and self-optimizing capabilities to proficiently tackle fast-growing dynamic variants of sophisticated malware threats and attacks with 99.01% detection accuracy. For a comprehensive evaluation, the authors employed current state-of-the-art malware datasets (Android Malware Dataset, Androzoo) with standard performance evaluation metrics. Moreover, MulDroid is compared with our constructed contemporary hybrid DL-driven architectures and benchmark algorithms. Our proposed mechanism outperforms in terms of detection accuracy with a trivial tradeoff speed efficiency. Additionally, a 10-fold cross-validation is performed to explicitly show unbiased results.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Citizen science; Community-based monitoring; Global survey; Multivariate analysis; Voluntary monitoring; Water; Water monitoring; Water quality	FEEDBACK; QUALITY	Citizen science projects spring up in freshwater monitoring, with an increasing number of projects in river, lake, and groundwater monitoring around the globe. Citizen science scholars assume that these projects have different designs, including diverse characteristics of citizens, institutions, and forms of interactions, potentially affecting the outcomes of these projects. Given the strong focus on case studies or reviews in the field, there is, however, little comparative evidence of the different types of citizen science projects in freshwater monitoring. Based on a global survey, this study provides a systematic comparative analysis of the design of 85 citizen science projects in the field of freshwater monitoring. Descriptive statistics reveal how projects differ along 45 literature-based design variables raised in the survey. Factor analysis based on 31 of these variables yields ten key design factors, and cluster analysis, based on these design factors, allows to identify seven distinguished clusters of citizen science projects. While these clusters are rather heterogeneous, they reveal differences between groups of projects regarding institutional motivation, citizen characteristics, and interaction forms. These results significantly add to a systematic comparison of citizen science projects in freshwater monitoring and enable a more effective involvement of citizens in environmental management.

As a rising field of research, citizen science has lately been fostered to gain new insights in fields of research, especially application oriented research. As citizen science experiences strong expectations in research fields connected to civil life, the article argues that citizen science must enable full participation of people with disabilities. To grant people with disabilities' access to these areas of life, participatory approaches should be the state of the art. Due to this, the article will start with a discursive discussion of different participatory approaches of various contexts. Thereby the different theoretical references, as (Participatory) Action Research, (Community-Based) Participatory Research, Practice Research, are presented and located into the methodological frame. After this, the focus is on the Citizen Science project "IncluScience - Disability Mainstreaming in science and practice" in which participatory approaches are being prepared in a target strand and bundled into a so-called "Citizen Science Toolbox".

In this manuscript, we explore what it means to participate in citizen science from two perspectives-that of a researcher designing and facilitating a citizen science project, and that of a citizen scientist volunteering the time and energy required for participation. We examine the methods and goals of the projects, describing the challenges faced by researchers and science volunteers alike as they participate in research processes aimed to increase community involvement in science and, by extension, environmental management issues. We describe how the constraints of citizen science models and methods underscore the importance of incorporating alternative anthropological and ethnographic approaches in coastal research, and offer eco-ethnography as a way for scientists to extend their citizen science projects to better reflect the needs and concerns of local communities impacted by climate change and sea-level rise.

As a potential solution, some game developers look to narrative as an experience-enhancing feature. Yet the impacts and affordances of narrative in citizen science games remain understudied, especially for games that require significant onboarding. Therefore, we investigated the effects of wrapping a story around the tutorial puzzles of the citizen science game Foldit. We found that the narrative increased the time players spent engaging with the game's tutorial and its scientific puzzles but did not substantially affect their progress through the tutorial. This article provides two major contributions: (1) empirical evidence detailing the impact of narrative on gameplay metrics in a citizen science game, including the relevant effects of genre preferences on engagement; and (2) recommendations on the use of narrative and its capacities in citizen science games. We conclude that the inclusion of a narrative can add valuable depth to the experience when designed thoughtfully and intentionally.

Citizen science is a cost-effective way to gather data over a large geographical range while simultaneously raising public awareness on the problem. Because the experiences of researchers involved in these projects are not yet adequately covered, this paper presents the findings from ten semi-structured qualitative interviews with researchers leading a citizen science project on micro- or macro plastics. Our results show it is important to specify the goal(s) of the project and that expertise on communication and data science is needed. Furthermore, simple protocols, quality control, and engagement with volunteers and the public are key elements for successful projects. From these results, a framework with recommendations was drafted, which can be used by anyone who wants to develop or improve citizen science projects.

Volunteers participate in citizen science activities online from their homes or in the field and are motivated by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Here, we investigated the possibility of integrating citizen science tasks within physical exercises envisaged as part of a potential rehabilitation therapy session. The citizen science activity entailed environmental mapping of a polluted body of water using a miniature instrumented boat, which was remotely controlled by the participants through their physical gesture tracked by a low-cost markerless motion capture system. Our findings demonstrate that the natural user interface offers an engaging and effective means for performing environmental monitoring tasks. At the same time, the citizen science activity increases the commitment of the participants, leading to a better motion performance, quantified through an array of objective indices. The study constitutes a first and necessary step toward rehabilitative treatments of the upper limb through citizen science and low-cost markerless optical systems.

Alongside its advantages, the involvement of lay people (volunteers, citizens) implies ethical concerns for scientists. Hence, this contribution aims to describe ethical concerns drawing on empirical cases found in the scientific literature on Citizen Science projects and public engagement related research projects where Citizen Science and public engagement are seen as complementary to science and technology. This review testifies that from an ethical perspective scientists encounter several multi-faceted occasions in both Citizen Science projects and public engagement related research projects, such as how to engage the public, to represent it, to accept public-provided data, to attribute authorship for public-sourced data and so on. In line with this, scientists ought to be socially responsible, and thus ethical. To make this possible, appropriate institutional policy should be developed or improved.

Their success depends on a diverse set of stakeholders working together-scientists, volunteers, and game developers. Yet the potential needs of these stakeholder groups and their possible tensions are poorly understood. To identify these needs and possible tensions, we conducted a qualitative data analysis of two years of ethnographic research and 57 interviews with stakeholders from 10 citizen science games, following a combination of grounded theory and reflexive thematic analysis. We identify individual stakeholder needs as well as important barriers to citizen science game success. These include the ambiguous allocation of developer roles, limited resources and funding dependencies, the need for a citizen science game community, and science-game tensions. We derive recommendations for addressing these barriers.

Fortunately, citizen science projects became a valuable tool to detect non-indigenous species (NIS), document their spread, prevent dispersion, and eradicate localized populations. We evaluated the most undisputed definitions of citizen science and proposed that a combination of two of them is a better reflection of what citizen science has become. Thus, citizen science is any environmental and/or biological data collection and analysis, including data quality control, undertaken by members of the general public, as individuals or as organized groups of citizens, with the guidance and/or assistance of scientists toward solving environmental and/or community questions. With this review, we also assessed how citizen science has been advancing biological invasions research and its focus, by analyzing 126 peer-reviewed articles that used citizen science methods or data concerning NIS. Most of the articles studied terrestrial species (68%) and terrestrial plants were the most studied group (22.7%). Surprisingly, most first detection reports were of non-indigenous marine fish probably due to the constraints in accessing aquatic ecosystems which delays the detection of new NIS. Citizen science projects running over broad geographical areas are very cost-effective for the early detection of NIS, regardless of the studied environment. We also discuss the applicability and need to adapt the methods and approaches toward the studied ecosystem and species, but also the profile of the participating citizens, their motivations, level of engagement, or social status. We recommend authors to better acknowledge the work done by contributing citizens, and the putative limitations of data generated by citizen science projects. The outreach planning of citizen science projects is also evaluated, including the use of dedicated web platforms vs. pre-existent and disseminated web platforms, while discussing how such outreach actions can be maximized. Lastly, we present a framework that contextualizes the contributions of citizen science, scientific research, and regional and national stakeholders toward the integrated management of biological invasions.

Usability Testing and Experience Design in Citizen Science A Case Study	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 38TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE DESIGN OF COMMUNICATION, SIGDOC 2020			English	Proceedings Paper	38th ACM International Conference on the Design of Communication (SIGDOC)	OCT 05-09, 2020	Univ North Texas, Dept Tech Communication, ELECTR NETWORK	Portland state Tech & professional writing, Univ Minnesota, Dep writing studies, Balsamiq	Univ North Texas, Dept Tech Communication	Usability; Accessibility; User Experience; Citizen Science		Networked communication technologies have been deployed in efforts to engage citizens in scientific inquiry through mediated approaches. The use of digital networked technologies in the citizen science space, however, retains the same problems of usability and access that other digital experiences in terms of inclusion. A user experience research orientation to the problem of citizen science inclusivity may prove to be useful to public science projects seeking to engage with citizen-users traditionally marginalized from citizen science projects. This paper contributes to that scholarship by outlining the initial inquiries into the usability of an online citizen science project. First, the paper briefly situates the history of citizen science from a citizen/user perspective. Then the paper reviews the contemporary relationships between user experience and usability in the design of citizen science efforts. Next, the paper grounds that discussion in an experience report of the citizen science project including the project managers goals for inclusive participation. Following that discussion, the presenters ground their discussion in the findings of a usability test developed for a citizen science project, SciStarter, through a graduate course focused on usability for technical communicators. The role of SciStarter.org is to connect potential participants with projects of interest, and as such serves a crucial function to the overall success of SciStarter and the individual projects housed there. To assess how effective, efficient, and satisfying it is to use the SciStarter website, we report on a remote moderated usability test was conducted on the desktop version of the site. The testing took place over several days in October 2019 and featured sessions with five participants. The article concludes by outlining challenges and opportunities for usability and user experience technical communicators to explore issues of inclusive user experience design and the teaching of such as well as contribute to inclusive citizen science efforts.

Although it is generally understood as a form of public engagement with science and technology, it can take various forms, with widely different roles for citizens. Despite this vastness, a contributory strand of citizen science dominates the field, which formally limits citizens' roles to those of data gatherers for professional scientists or experts. This has led critics to argue that citizen science is not as inclusive, socially transformative, or democratizing as its advocates claim, and to appeals by scholars, practitioners, and policymakers for more dialogue and deliberation in all stages of citizen science processes. In this piece, we share our reflections on these questions drawing on our experiences as participant observers in contributory citizen science projects in various parts of the world. Responding to the above critiques, we illustrate how such projects can have emancipatory potential in terms of impacting policy agendas, inciting behavioral change, and engaging hard -to -reach societal groups. We argue that the future of citizen science lies in pluralizing the citizen sciences by experimenting with various modes of democratic representation, participation, and deliberation.

BOINC is the main middleware system for this type of computing. The aim of volunteer computing is that organizations be able to attain large computing power thanks to the participation of volunteer clients instead of a high investment in infrastructure. There are projects, like the ATLAS@home project, in which the number of running jobs has reached a plateau, due to a high load on data servers caused by file transfer. This is why we have designed an alternative, using the same BOINC infrastructure, in order to improve the performance of BOINC projects that have reached their physical limit. This alternative involves having a percentage of the volunteer clients running as data servers, called data volunteers, that improve the performance by reducing the load on data servers. This paper describes our alternative in detail and shows the performance of the solution using a simulator of our own, ComBoS.

J	Lee, YC; Zomaya, AY; Siegel, HJ				Lee, Young Choon; Zomaya, Albert Y.; Siegel, Howard Jay			Robust task scheduling for volunteer computing systems	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						Scheduling; Volunteer computing; Robustness; Resource allocation; Distributed systems	RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; STATIC ALLOCATION; HEURISTICS; ALGORITHM; MAKESPAN; SUBTASKS	Performance perturbations are a natural phenomenon in volunteer computing systems. Scheduling parallel applications with precedence-constraints is emerging as a new challenge in these systems. In this paper, we propose two novel robust task scheduling heuristics, which identify best task-resource matches in terms of makespan and robustness. Our approach for both heuristics is based on a proactive reallocation (or schedule expansion) scheme enabling output schedules to tolerate a certain degree of performance degradation. Schedules are initially generated by focusing on their makespan. These schedules are scrutinized for possible rescheduling using additional volunteer computing resources to increase their robustness. Specifically, their robustness is improved by maximizing either the total allowable delay time or the minimum relative allowable delay time over all allocated volunteer resources. Allowable delay times may occur due to precedence constraints. In this paper, two proposed heuristics are evaluated with an extensive set of simulations. Based on simulation results, our approach significantly contributes to improving the robustness of the resulting schedules.

Citizen science may serve as a valuable resource for monitoring biodiversity and informing decision-making processes, but its use has not been investigated within the realm of environmental review. We sought to quantify the extent to which citizen science data are currently being used, mentioned, or suggested in environmental impact statements (EISs) by analyzing more than 1300 EISs produced under the US National Environmental Policy Act. Among the sampled EISs, we found increasing incorporation of citizen science within the environmental review process, with 40% of EISs in 2022 using, mentioning, or suggesting use of such information, as compared with just 3% in 2012. Citizen science offers substantial potential to enhance biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts within environmental review, but numerous considerations must be broadly discussed before citizen science data can be widely adopted.

J	Weingart, P; Meyer, C				Weingart, Peter; Meyer, Corlia			Citizen science in South Africa: Rhetoric and reality	PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE			English	Article						citizen science; participation; public; research; South Africa	KNOWLEDGE	Citizen science, and public engagement with science, has become prominent in science policy programmes. Given the expectations attached to citizen science in academic and science policy discourses, it is worthwhile to look at where the actual work is done. The case of South Africa, the study focus, is interesting because the country follows similar programmes as many developed countries, but has a socioeconomically and educationally more unequal society. Thus, South Africa presented a test example of whether the institutional similarities of science or socioeconomic and educational differences prevail in shaping the reality of citizen science. Results from 56 projects showed that nearly all of them were limited to data collection in life science fields and were managed largely by one university and mainly communicated within the respective science communities. This led us to conclude that the ambitious rhetoric accompanying citizen science in science policy programmes is not matched by reality.

Tactile Internet has enabled the interaction between humans and machines within their environment to achieve revolutionized solutions both on the move and in real-time. Many applications such as intelligent autonomous self-driving, smart agriculture and industrial solutions, and self-learning multimedia content filtering and sharing have become attainable through cooperative, distributed, and decentralized systems, namely, volunteer computing. This article introduces a blockchain-enabled resource sharing and service composition solution through volunteer computing. Device resource, computing, and intelligence capabilities are advertised in the environment to be made discoverable and available for sharing with the aid of blockchain technology. Incentives in the form of on-demand service availability are given to resource and service providers to ensure fair and balanced cooperative resource usage. Blockchains are formed whenever a service request is initiated with the aid of fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) devices to ensure secure communication and service delivery for the participants. Using both volunteer computing techniques and tactile internet architectures, we devise a fast and reliable service provisioning framework that relies on a reinforcement learning technique. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve high reward distribution, increased number of blockchain formations, reduced delays, and balanced resource usage among participants, under the premise of high IoT device availability.

Additionally, we explore the connection between citizen science and quantum computer games, games played on quantum computers. The information presented is derived from academic references and supplemented by diverse sources, including social media publications, conference presentations and blog posts from research groups and developers associated with the presented games. We observe that the current landscape of quantum games is shaped by three distinct driving forces: the serious application of games, the evolution of quantum computers and open game development events such as Quantum Game Jams. Notably, citizen science plays an influential role in all three aspects. The article points to existing design guides for citizen science quantum games and views future prospects of citizen science projects and quantum games through collaborative endeavours, human-machine collaboration and open access quantum computers.

However, its potential contribution in this field is limited by stakeholders' perceptions on the value and utility of data collected in this way. This is exacerbated in the Australian context by insufficient resources to inform management regarding the country's extensive coastline. The present study employs a systems thinking methodology to map stakeholders' conceptual models of citizen science in Western Australia. This shows that a fundamental policy shift must occur in order to,encompass the views of all stakeholders and converge on a common understanding of its role and utility of citizen science beyond the current science-centric discourse.

However, there are limited scientific studies addressing this concern and showing the data value. In this study, we established a citizen science program in the Akaki catchment which hosts Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Citizen scientists monitored river stage at multiple gauging sites for multiple years. We evaluated the quality of citizen science data through a systematic quality control. Reference data was obtained from neighboring stations of the citizen science program and professionals while the evaluation involved graphical inspections and statistical methods. The quality-controlled data were applied to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of rainfall-runoff relationships. Initially, large numbers of suspicious data were detected using single station data but that was significantly reduced when the data of multiple sites were compared. Further comparison against professional data revealed excellent agreement with high correlation coefficient (r >0.95), and low centered root mean square error (RMSE) <0.03-0.08 mm. The citizen science data indicated a large difference in rainfall-runoff relationship over the dominantly urban and rural sub-catchments. The citizen science data allowed comparison of runoff coefficient and base flow index for recent and historical periods where recent streamflow data is unavailable from a formal data source. This study illustrates the immense value of (i) multiple data quality assessment steps for building confidence on the quality of citizen science data, and (ii) citizen science for enhancing our understanding of rainfall-runoff relationships and change in a rapidly urbanizing catchment.

J	Kowalska-Chrzanowska, M				Kowalska-Chrzanowska, Malgorzata			Involvement of polish libraries in citizen science	JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						Citizen science; libraries; library staff; Poland; survey research		The article discusses the involvement of Polish libraries in citizen science. Based on a survey of library staff, the author answers whether Polish libraries are involved in promoting the idea of citizen science, how they participate in projects in this field and what barriers they encounter doing so. The research used the diagnostic survey method. The survey questionnaire contained nine questions and demographics. The survey was available in the LimeSurvey system from November 2, 2023, to January 31, 2024. A link to the survey was sent via e-mail to over 600 librarians of various types of libraries using the Association of Polish Librarians mailing list. It was also shared on Facebook. In response to the survey, 256 responses were received, of which only 107 were complete. The research proves that Polish libraries are involved in citizen science to a limited extent. Only 25% of the surveyed librarians admitted that their institution is involved in projects in this field, and this involvement comes down to providing library resources and lending technical infrastructure. Only four people (3.6% of all respondents) stated that citizen science is a priority in their institutions (which means that the library promotes citizen science, launches independent projects, creates resources, and conducts workshops for scientists and volunteers). As many as 63% of librarians said their institutions are currently separate from citizen science. Polish librarians listed the most significant barriers hindering involvement in citizen science: resource shortages (human resources, financial resources and equipment) and a low level of knowledge about the essence of citizen science and the possibilities of incorporating its projects into library activities.

A Buzz for Sustainability and Conservation: The Growing Potential of Citizen Science Studies on Bees	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						bee monitoring; beekeeping; citizen science principles; pollination; sustainable development goals	BIODIVERSITY; POLLINATORS; KNOWLEDGE; RISK	Expanding involvement of the public in citizen science projects can benefit both volunteers and professional scientists alike. Recently, citizen science has come into focus as an important data source for reporting and monitoring United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Since bees play an essential role in the pollination ecosystem service, citizen science projects involving them have a high potential for attaining SDGs. By performing a systematic review of citizen science studies on bees, we assessed how these studies could contribute towards SDG reporting and monitoring, and also verified compliance with citizen science principles. Eighty eight studies published from 1992 to 2020 were collected. SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 17 (Partnerships) were the most outstanding, potentially contributing to targets related to biodiversity protection, restoration and sustainable use, capacity building and establishing multi stakeholder partnerships. SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) were also addressed. Studies were found to produce new knowledge, apply methods to improve data quality, and invest in open access publishing. Notably, volunteer participation was mainly restricted to data collection. Further challenges include extending these initiatives to developing countries, where only a few citizen science projects are underway.

One approach is to incorporate anthropomorphism (ascribing humanlike qualities to a non-human agent) when designing and deploying technology. In a quasi-experimental study conducted as part of the Citizen-Enabled Aerosol Measurements for Satellites (CEAMS) citizen science project, we investigated the relationship between anthropomorphism and motivation to participate in citizen science. Findings showed partial support for the relationship between anthropomorphism and motivation.

Formulation of citizen science approach for monitoring Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation for an Indian city	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						citizen science; clean water; community volunteers; local participation; sanitation; Sustainable Development Goal; Tirunelveli	SDG; POLITICS; PERFORMANCE; CHALLENGES; IMPACT	The United Nations acknowledges that action in one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will impact outcomes in others and that development should interact the social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Many countries have prioritized goals and targets based on their current progress and the prosperity of their people. This article focused on SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation, especially the first two (6.1 and 6.2) out of eight targets. The author has considered SDG 6, a critical goal to focus on and achieve in Tirunelveli city municipal corporation. The study area is situated in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu, India's southernmost state. Citizen science (CS), also known as community science, has emerged as an effective method of collecting data and supporting a wide range of indicators from the SDG targets. The objective of this article is to utilize the benefit of the CS approach for monitoring the targets 6.1 and 6.2 pertained to drinking water and sanitation facilities respectively in the study area. The activities suggested for this SDG 6 CS project were framing the core question, identification of citizen scientists, data analysis, and action plan. College students, ward councilors, and community volunteers, referred to as three categories of citizen scientists, will collect household data for all 55 wards in the study area. The value of the collected data to various government agencies and monitoring organizations is also discussed.

Research suggests that while several factors contribute to this lack of diverse participation in citizen science, the critical hurdle may be an absence of alignment between community priorities and research objectives.

One is the biosphere, the other human society and economy. Neither is modellable nor manageable because both operate intricately and chaotically, and from time to time catastrophically. Civic science is negotiated science where future states are envisaged through open structures of learning, consensus-seeking and bargaining. This suggests that interdisciplinary science is more than the fusion of disciplines. It is the transformation of science into democratic structures through which fairer decisions can be made. Geographers should be singularly capable of adopting civic science, but they cannot do so on their own.

Data shared in citizen science includes information on volunteer location or other sensitive personal information; yet, volunteers do not typically express privacy concerns. This study uses the framework of contextual integrity to understand privacy accounting in the context of citizen science, by analyzing contextual variables including roles; information types; data flows and transmission principles; and, uses, norms, and values. Findings show that uses, norms, and values-including core values shared by researchers and public volunteers, and the motivations of individual volunteers-have a significant impact on privacy accounting. Overall, citizen science volunteers and practitioners share and promote openness and data sharing over protecting privacy. Studying the context of citizen science offers an example of contextually-appropriate data sharing that can inform broader questions about research ethics in an age of pervasive data. Based on these findings, this paper offers implications for designing data and information flows and supporting technologies in public and voluntary data sharing projects.

A draw back of volunteer computing is the unreliability of the donated resources, so redundancy is required to guarantee the fulfillment of tasks or the availability of data In this work we consider the problem of designing a directory service policy for a Distributed Volunteer Computing Micro-Blogging Service (DVCMBS). In such services, nodes donate storage space (repositories), which is managed by a centralized directory service that decides which nodes will store replicas of blogs, ensuring their online availability when bloggers are offline. Since nodes are under no obligation to remain online, the task of a DVCMBS directory service is to allocate blog replicas to online repositories, such that the rate of availability of all blogs is maximized. At the same time, since donated storage resources are limited and directory service operations use processing resources, minimizing the number of blog replicas generated (i.e., the inefficiency of the directory service) is critical. We present a simulation model of a DVCMBS, which uses a probabilistic sort and select approach to select host repositories for replicas and blogs to replicate. Exhaustive computational experiments analyze the trade-off between blog replica availability and efficiency, and identify the efficient directory service policies, with respect to availability and efficiency maximization.

This paper focuses on "citizen science," which constitutes an important part of open science movements. Although citizen science enables large-scale data collection and processing with the help of a number of citizen volunteers, conducting a successful citizen science project is often beyond the capacity of a small group of researchers. We will examine what types of support can be effective for successful citizen science projects, based on our experience with Minna de Honkoku, a citizen science project in the field of historical seismology. Minna de Honkoku collaborates with citizens by inviting them to transcribe a large number of historical earthquake records. As of March 2018, 4.3 million characters, written in old Japanese, have been transcribed by over 3,000 registered users. The analysis of the development process of our project suggests that in order to promote open science projects, academic institutions need to provide support for software development and public relations.

In BOINC projects, heterogeneous resources distributed across the Internet are used for large-scale scientific simulations. The large need for resources in BOINC projects often competes with volunteer preferences: volunteers can impose limits on the use of their idle resources. Most of the time maximum project performance can be achieved only when volunteer preferences are neglected. To address this problem, we propose a novel optimization procedure based on constraint optimization techniques that actively allocates volunteer resources to improve project throughput and, at, the same time, aims to preserve Volunteer preferences. We, show the increase in project; throughput obtained with our approach and discuss the trade-off between volunteer preferences and project throughput.

J	Hunter, J; Alabri, A; van Ingen, C				Hunter, Jane; Alabri, Abdulmonem; van Ingen, Catharine			Assessing the quality and trustworthiness of citizen science data	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						citizen science; data quality; trust metrics	TRUST	The Internet, Web 2.0 and Social Networking technologies are enabling citizens to actively participate in 'citizen science' projects by contributing data to scientific programmes via the Web. However, the limited training, knowledge and expertise of contributors can lead to poor quality, misleading or even malicious data being submitted. Subsequently, the scientific community often perceive citizen science data as not worthy of being used in serious scientific research-which in turn, leads to poor retention rates for volunteers. In this paper, we describe a technological framework that combines data quality improvements and trust metrics to enhance the reliability of citizen science data. We describe how online social trust models can provide a simple and effective mechanism for measuring the trustworthiness of community-generated data. We also describe filtering services that remove unreliable or untrusted data and enable scientists to confidently reuse citizen science data. The resulting software services are evaluated in the context of the CoralWatch project-a citizen science project that uses volunteers to collect comprehensive data on coral reef health.

In this study, the MAICC model is introduced, a tool designed to foster complex thinking in higher education students through the evaluation of citizen science projects. It integrates research-based learning and service learning, and helps develop critical and reflective skills by applying them to real-life settings. To assess student engagement and skills development, a mixed methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative analysis was used. Findings indicate that the MAICC model promotes complex thinking, enhances critical thinking through citizen science project evaluation, and features an emphasis on citizen science and educational technology. Discussion highlights citizen science's important role in education and suggests future research exploring its wider application across disciplines and contexts to enhance 21st century skills.

Problems exist due to socioeconomic variations between countries and the qualitative nature of certain indicators in their definition. Citizen science has the potential to contribute to several SDGs. However, whilst citizen science's potential to contribute towards SDGs is well documented, limitations exist when measuring the impact that citizen science has made toward SDG progress. To better understand the issues and prospective solutions surrounding impact assessment towards SDG progress, this work presents the outcomes of semi-structured interviews with citizen science project coordinators. They reveal the complex nature of impact assessment within a citizen science context. Coordinators demonstrate greater confidence when the project is easier to relate to the SDGs, and the project methodology can objectively measure indicators. Issues exist, however, when considering SDGs with a broader, global context, those more difficult to link to project goals and when the project's impact on them happens at timescales beyond the funding period. If the full potential of citizen-science contributions to the SDGs is to be realised, approaches are needed to fully consider practitioners' needs and motivations.

SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						citizen science; citizen engagement; biology; health; medicine; astronomy; peer review; behaviour change	ENGAGEMENT; ATTITUDES; PROJECT; PROGRAM	Citizen science projects, which entail scientific work undertaken by members of the public, have increased substantially over the last three decades. However, the credibility of such science has been questioned, especially with respect to its prospects for producing peer-reviewed publications, the principal means by which science is communicated and validated. We conducted a meta-analysis of 895 citizen science projects launched between 1890 and 2018. Three-quarters (674) did not produce a single peer-reviewed paper. The remaining 221 projects produced 2075 publications, although just five projects accounted for nearly half the publications. The average time from project launch to first publication was 9.15 years. Projects in health and medicine and astronomy were most likely to produce publications. Projects in biology (65.8% of all projects), computer science, and social sciences were least likely to publish their results. In conclusion, the "science" element of most citizen science projects is largely irrelevant as it is never validated or communicated. We propose reclassifying citizen science projects into two types: (i) Citizen Science, where the focus is on science, and participants essentially function as sampling devices; and (ii) Citizen Engagement, where the value lies more in citizen engagement than it does in citizen science.

With progress in sensor technologies and IoT, our cities and neighbourhoods are increasingly sensed, measured and observed. While such data are often used to inform citizen science projects, it is still difficult to understand how citizens and communities discuss citizen science activities and engage with citizen science projects. Understanding these engagements in greater depth will provide citizen scientists, project owners, practitioners and the generic public with insights around how social media can be used to share citizen science related topics, particularly to help increase visibility, influence change and in general and raise awareness on topics. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first large-scale study on understanding how such information is discussed on Twitter, particularly outside the scope of individual projects. The paper reports on the wide variety of topics (e.g., politics, news, ecological observations) being discussed on social media and a wide variety of network types and the varied roles played by users in sharing information in Twitter. Based on these findings, the paper highlights recommendations for stakeholders for engaging with citizen science topics.

These include questions regarding public engagement, project design and measures of success. The aim of this study is to better understand what makes citizen science projects scientifically successful, and highlight what can be learned and implemented in future project design. We focus on scientifically productive projects as a success measure that can encourage greater scientists' involvement in citizen science, and analyze five of these projects for factors that contribute to their success. We found that although all projects have strong scientific goals, they all have additional strong emphases on communication and social practices, providing a good user experience and generating motivation and empowerment. We provide five heuristics for the future design of citizen science projects, which focus on engagement and communication features which we believe are important for citizen science project success.

Launching the VASCO Citizen Science Project	UNIVERSE			English	Article						surveys; transients; SETI; citizen science	GALAXY ZOO; RED	The Vanishing & Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations (VASCO) project investigates astronomical surveys spanning a time interval of 70 years, searching for unusual and exotic transients. We present herein the VASCO Citizen Science Project, which can identify unusual candidates driven by three different approaches: hypothesis, exploratory, and machine learning, which is particularly useful for SETI searches. To address the big data challenge, VASCO combines three methods: the Virtual Observatory, user-aided machine learning, and visual inspection through citizen science. Here we demonstrate the citizen science project and its improved candidate selection process, and we give a progress report. We also present the VASCO citizen science network led by amateur astronomy associations mainly located in Algeria, Cameroon, and Nigeria. At the moment of writing, the citizen science project has carefully examined 15,593 candidate image pairs in the data (ca. 10% of the candidates), and has so far identified 798 objects classified as "vanished". The most interesting candidates will be followed up with optical and infrared imaging, together with the observations by the most potent radio telescopes.

When creating applications for citizen science projects, data quality, privacy and provenance are important characteristics of such applications. Therefore, the objective of this research is to find out how well data quality, privacy and provenance are handled in ongoing citizen science projects. A number of citizen science projects have been compared against ISO/IEC 25012 data quality standard characteristics. Results show that data quality is mostly lacking in the areas of accuracy, privacy, provenance and availability. Projects have not implemented decent accuracy checks when giving data, projects show the real name and location of participants and such data should not be available to others. Management of provenance is not found in many projects but where it is found, provenance is either really well or extremely poorly handled. Many of these issues could be easily solved with proper data management and testing. At the end of this article, multiple suggestions are given to improve data quality, provenance and privacy in citizen science project applications..

Launching an Efficient Participatory Sensing Campaign: A Smart Mobile Device-Based Approach	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Design; Algorithms; Performance; Participatory sensing; deployment; recruitment; tensor; DTA; trajectory	REPUTATION	Participatory sensing is a promising sensing paradigm that enables collection, processing, dissemination and analysis of the phenomena of interest by ordinary citizens through their handheld sensing devices. Participatory sensing has huge potential in many applications, such as smart transportation and air quality monitoring. However, participants may submit low-quality, misleading, inaccurate, or even malicious data if a participatory sensing campaign is not launched effectively. Therefore, it has become a significant issue to establish an efficient participatory sensing campaign for improving the data quality. This article proposes a novel five-tier framework of participatory sensing and addresses several technical challenges in this proposed framework including: (1) optimized deployment of data collection points (DC-points); and (2) efficient recruitment strategy of participants. Toward this end, the deployment of DC-points is formulated as an optimization problem with maximum utilization of sensor and then a Wise-Dynamic DC-points Deployment (WD3) algorithm is designed for high-quality sensing. Furthermore, to guarantee the reliable sensing data collection and communication, a trajectory-based strategy for participant recruitment is proposed to enable campaign organizers to identify well-suited participants for data sensing based on a joint consideration of temporal availability, trust, and energy. Extensive experiments and performance analysis of the proposed framework and associated algorithms are conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a good sensing coverage with a smaller number of DC-points, and the participants that are termed as social sensors are easily selected, to evaluate the feasibility and extensibility of the proposed recruitment strategies.

However, building a large dedicated cluster for MapReduce is not cost effective if the system is underutilized. To speedup the MapReduce computation with low cost, the computing resources donated from idle desktop/notebook computers in an organization become true potential. The MapReduce framework is then implemented into Volunteer Computing environment to allow such data processing tasks to be carried out on the unused computers. Virtualization technology is deployed to resolve the security and heterogeneity problem in Volunteer Computing so that the MapReduce jobs can always run under a unified runtime and isolated environment. This paper presents a Hadoop cluster that can be scaled into virtualized Volunteer Computing environment. The system consists of a small fixed set of dedicate nodes plus a variable number of volatile volunteer nodes which give additional computing power to the cluster. To this end, we consolidate Apache Hadoop, the most popular MapReduce implementation, with the virtualized BOINC platform. We evaluate the proposed system on our testbed with MapReduce benchmark that represents different workload patterns. The performance of the Hadoop cluster is measured when its computing capability is expanded with volunteer nodes. The results show that the system can be scaled preferably for CPU-intensive jobs, as opposed to data-intensive jobs which their scalability is more restricted.

Location Worldwide. Methods We first set a general framework highlighting the prerequisites of a relevant dataset for conservation biogeography. We then illustrate how many different citizen science programmes currently running in different countries can be placed within this framework. Results We highlight that citizen science is particularly useful to address issues spanning large temporal and spatial extents. We then show how datasets based on citizen science can be used to investigate major aspects of global change impacts on biodiversity. We further highlight why these programmes are also particularly valuable in developing the preventative and educational component of conservation biogeography. Main conclusions Conservation biogeography requires considerable amounts of data collected over large spatial and/or temporal extents. Beyond increasing technical advances to collect and analyse these data, citizen science seems to be a highly valuable tool in many aspects. However, while citizen science programmes are now popular and increasingly used in several countries, they are lacking in many others. We argue that the development of citizen science programmes should be encouraged as they can both be highly valuable for conservation biogeography and promote the reconnection between people and nature and more generally between people and science.

Citizen science and social licence: Improving perceptions and connecting marine user groups	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Citizen science; Marine resource use; Social licence; Stakeholder engagement; Trust	CONSERVATION SCIENCE; OPERATE; GOVERNANCE; PARTICIPANTS; LEGITIMACY; INTERVIEWS; MANAGEMENT; MATTER; SCALE; TOOL	Marine stakeholder groups have diverse relationships with the ocean and life within it, which can create conflict and distrust between them. Citizen science and social licence present promising means to develop dialogue between these diverse marine stakeholders and improve outcomes for marine management. Citizen science can be defined as public engagement in scientific research and activities and amongst other benefits, has been demonstrated to improve communication and relationships amongst resource management and stakeholder groups. Social licence is a concept that reflects unwritten permission from the public for others to use and manage natural resources, and has become an important theme for development in the marine realm. We explore a case-study of the marine citizen science programme Redmap Australia, utilising a mixed-methods approach to understand community perceptions of other marine user groups. We explore how marine users legitimise one another, and how this relates to building relationships and developing social licence. Our results show that participation in citizen science can allow users to display their marine citizenship and shared concern about the marine environment, and that this can allow them to earn trust from other user groups. We conclude that participation in citizen science improves perceptions of trustworthiness and can enhance social licence for marine user groups, with positive implications for marine and coastal management. These outcomes provide fruitful insights on marine resource user groups' perceptions that can help to advise future developments in the growing fields of citizen science practice and citizen science research.

It demonstrates platform features like visualization of different pollution maps, enabling participatory sensing via operator-initiated measurement campaigns, wherein reporters (e. g., citizens, public servants) are invited to submit measurements via mobile applications, creation of air quality alerts when pollutant thresholds are exceeded, local and remote configuration of mobile app and sensor devices, as well as pollutant statistics. In addition, various use cases like a health information service, urban planning, or workplace safety that can be realized by means of this platform are presented.

However, the frequent mismatch between in situ data-quality requirements for remote-sensing-product development and current data quality assurance in citizen science presents a significant challenge if widespread use of these complementary data sources is to be achieved. To evaluate the scope of this challenge, we conducted a targeted literature review into the nature of data-quality issues faced by citizen-science projects for routine incorporation into terrestrial environmental-monitoring systems. From the literature, we identify the challenges and trade-offs to inform best-practice implementation of data quality assurance in citizen-science projects. To assist practitioners in implementing our findings, we grouped these themes by stage of citizen-science project: (1) program planning and design; (2) participant engagement; (3) data collection; and (4) data processing. As a final step, we used our findings as the basis to formulate guiding questions that can be used to inform decision making when choosing optimal data-quality-improvement and assurance strategies for use of citizen science in remote-sensing calibration and/or validation. Our aim is to enhance future development of citizen-science projects for use with remote sensing in environmental monitoring.

Two principal approaches to citizen-science projects in ecology can be characterized as the data-first approach and the question-first approach. Here, we highlight the value of question-first citizen-science projects for providing insights into the ecology and management of urban wildlife, using case studies on (1) beneficial insects (pollinators, predators and parasitoids) and (2) possums and gliders in Australian cities and towns. The question-first approach has many benefits, offering a platform to engage volunteers with the scientific process and the broader context of an ecological or conservation problem, while also connecting them with their local environment. Identifying the questions to be addressed in a citizen-science project ahead of data collection allows for co-design and stronger collaboration with volunteers, community groups, local experts, and landscape managers. Question-first citizen science can also provide valuable ecological data that extend substantially beyond presence-only records, including presence-absence data collected via timed surveys and information on animal behavior and interspecific interactions. However, establishing and maintaining question-first citizen-science projects can be challenging, requiring the building and maintenance of many relationships and a multidisciplinary approach that goes well beyond the usual activities of an academic researcher. Well-designed, question-first citizen science has the capacity to achieve both scientific rigor and meaningful engagement with volunteer participants.

J	Rani, M; Guleria, K; Panda, SN				Rani, Meena; Guleria, Kalpna; Panda, Surya Narayan			Enhancing QoS in Delay-Sensitive IoT Applications through Volunteer Computing in Fog Environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article						Volunteer computing; Quality of service; Task scheduling; Cost efficiency; Resource use efficiency; Min-CCV; Min- V	CLOUD; MANAGEMENT; ENERGY	An online distributed system which is helpful for users to contribute their surplus resources to handle the wide range of tasks is called volunteer computing. In Volunteer Computing System (VCS) technology, there exists heterogeneous devices which vary in terms of processing power, latency, cost, and energy efficiency. VCS is heterogeneous in nature so, it is essential to utilize all the resources to provide high Quality of Service (QoS), innovation and cost effectiveness for all requests. The dynamism and heterogeneity of VCS makes it essential to utilize all the resources for providing excellent Quality of Service(QoS). This innovation is also cost effective for all the requests. Task scheduling problems that are classified as NP-hard are very challenging in heterogeneous VCS environments. Therefore, two scheduling algorithms Min-CCV and Min-V are proposed for volunteer computing systems. The primary objective of the proposed algorithms is to improve network performance and also enhance the QoS by reducing the computational, communicational, and violational costs for various Internet of Things (IoT) based applications which in turn improves the quality of life. A task scheduler module allocates tasks Ti i as a group of n jobs that are identified T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , , T n for a volunteer computing system. These tasks have specific attributes like memory requirement, input and output file sizes, QoS requirements, etc. The outcome of the simulator describes that the proposed algorithm can allocate tasks in a more efficient way to the volunteer fog-cloud environment in comparison to existing methods. As compared to the generic-based algorithms, the proposed Min-CCV and Min-V algorithms enhance the deadline satisfaction rate to approximately 99.5% and decrease the costs incurred by 15 to 53%. The comprehensive simulation results give the better outcome of proposed work as compared to existing practices.

Modeling eighteen years of community science data reveals extensive recolonization of bobcats in Illinois, USA	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bobcat; Distribution; Lynx rufus; Occupancy; Expansion; Recolonization; Spatial occupancy model	ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY; LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; CITIZEN SCIENCE; LARGE CARNIVORES; RANGE DYNAMICS; HABITAT USE; LYNX-RUFUS; SPACE USE; LAND-USE; LANDSCAPE	ContextMany terrestrial mammals have undergone substantial distribution changes in recent decades; yet collecting broad-scale occurrence data for carnivores is difficult due to their low densities and cryptic behaviors. Carnivore observations from community (i.e., citizen) science programs can be a potentially valuable approach for understanding changes in carnivore distributions over long time periods. ObjectivesWe used 18 years of bobcat (Lynx rufus) observations collected by archery deer hunters (i.e., participants) across Illinois, USA, to estimate spatiotemporal patterns in occurrence and determine how landscape features influenced patterns of recolonization. MethodsWe developed Bayesian spatial and non-spatial multi-scale dynamic occupancy models to estimate county-level occupancy, persistence, and colonization and participant-level occupancy. We modeled county-level parameters as a function of multiple a priori landscape covariates and compared model predictive performance using cross-validation. ResultsOur non-spatial occupancy model had greater predictive support than our spatial occupancy model. Mean annual statewide county-level occupancy increased from approximately 0.43-0.83 while mean annual participant-level occupancy increased from approximately 0.07-0.28. Bobcats were primarily restricted to southern Illinois during the early 2000s but by 2018 occurred throughout western and southern Illinois. Landscape covariates had relatively weak effects on model parameters. ConclusionsOur study illustrates how community science observations analyzed with hierarchical occupancy models can be used to model spatiotemporal changes in species distributions. Bobcats have recolonized much of Illinois, but this colonization was not strongly mediated by county-level landscape features at the scales we measured.

Characteristics of immersive citizen science experiences that drive conservation engagement	PEOPLE AND NATURE			English	Article						citizen science; conservation action; ecotourism; engagement; nature experiences; volunteering; wildlife	TRANSFORMATIVE LEARNING-THEORY; ENVIRONMENTAL KNOWLEDGE; SELF-EFFICACY; EDUCATION; PARTICIPATION; MOTIVATIONS; BEHAVIOR; SUPPORT; SUSTAINABILITY; EXTINCTION	The biodiversity crisis poses a real and present global threat to humanity. The acceleration of species and ecosystem decline coupled with climate change suggests that as it stands, nature cannot absorb the pressure humanity is placing on the planet. Bold new approaches to biodiversity conservation are needed. Promoting an engaged community is an important part of achieving conservation outcomes. Research shows that citizen science has the potential to elicit conservation engagement. However, research has not specifically explored how intensive citizen science expedition programs contribute to change. Here we use transformative learning theory as a tool to investigate how participation in citizen science programs influences conservation engagement. We analysed evaluation surveys of Earthwatch Institute citizen science participants (N = 608) and conducted in-depth interviews (N = 11), to examine the links between citizen science experiences and engagement outcomes. We discovered that while nature-based components of citizen science programs attract participants and create a salient environment for transformation, these are not objectively associated with engagement outcomes. Strengthened awareness was associated with learning, social interactions and cultural experiences, whereas intentions to engage in conservation action was only influenced by experiencing a sense of contribution. Rather than focusing only on learning and nature experiences, our results suggest that the elements of citizen science programs which support social change may require allowing participants to develop a sense of contribution amid an interactive social environment.

Despite numerous benefits of citizen science for both the advancement of science and the community of the citizen scientists, there is still no comprehensive knowledge of patterns of contributions, and the demography of contributors to citizen science projects. In this paper we provide a first overview of spatiotemporal and gender distribution of citizen science workforce by analyzing 54 million classifications contributed by more than 340 thousand citizen science volunteers from 198 countries to one of the largest online citizen science platforms, Zooniverse. First we report on the uneven geographical distribution of the citizen scientist and model the variations among countries based on the socio-economic conditions as well as the level of research investment in each country. Analyzing the temporal features of contributions, we report on high "burstiness" of participation instances as well as the leisurely nature of participation suggested by the time of the day that the citizen scientists were the most active. Finally, we discuss the gender imbalance among online citizen scientists (about 30% female) and compare it with other collaborative projects as well as the gender distribution in more formal scientific activities. Online citizen science projects need further attention from outside of the academic community, and our findings can help attract the attention of public and private stakeholders, as well as to inform the design of the platforms and science policy making processes.

The collection and distribution of these huge trajectory data may jeopardize the privacy of the participators. By knowing and tracking the user trajectories by the malicious parties could possibly endanger the user's private information like religious habits, daily routines, health issues etc. The fear of privacy leakage may certainly to have a rethink among the participators for being the part of participatory sensing system and this will surely degrade the success of the system. In this survey, we identify the various participatory sensing privacy protection methods used in the existing participatory sensing applications and also analyses the threats from the adversaries that may affect the user privacy. We also investigate and discuss the effectiveness of various existing trajectory privacy preserving methods and checks the suitability of these methods in real-world situations. As a concluding part, we suggest the possible solutions to counter the open issues and maximize the privacy of participators in this system.

These platforms function as social machines, combining volunteer efforts with automated processes to enable distributed data analysis. The rapid growth of this approach is increasing the need to understand how we can improve volunteer interaction and engagement. Here, we utilize the most comprehensive collection of online citizen science data gathered to date to examine multiple variables across 63 Zooniverse projects. Our analyses reveal how subtle design changes can influence many facets of volunteer interaction, generating insights that have implications for the design and study of citizen science projects, and future research.

Citizen science has become increasingly popular recently, supported by the proliferation of mobile communication technologies such as smartphones. However, citizen science methodologies have not yet been widely adopted in agricultural research. Here, we conducted an online survey with 57 British and French farmers in 2014. We investigated (1) farmer ownership and use of smartphone technologies, (2) farmer use of farm-specific management apps, and (3) farmer interest and willingness to participate in agricultural citizen science projects. Our results show that 89 % respondents owned a smartphone, 84% used it for farm management, and 72% used it on a daily basis. Fifty-nine percent engaged with farm-specific apps, using on average four apps. Ninety-three percent respondents agreed that citizen science was a useful methodology for data collection, 93 % for real-time monitoring, 83 % for identification of research questions, 72 % for experimental work, and 72 % for wildlife recording. Farmers also showed strong interest to participate in citizen science projects, often willing to commit substantial amounts of time. For example, 54 % of British respondents were willing to participate in farmland wildlife recording once a week or monthly. Although financial support was not always regarded as necessary, experimental work was the most likely activity for which respondents thought financial support would be essential. Overall, this is the first study to quantify and explore farmers' use of smartphones for farm management, and document strong support for farm-based citizen science projects.

Although there are two key advantages to this approach, its low cost and wide range of sensing, they come at the tradeoff of both the battery and storage. Therefore, efficient collection is required. There is also a challenge posed by how to collect data from environments in which the network infrastructure does not work. Previously, we proposed a data collection method using the location and time information of data in sinks as efficient data collection for participatory sensing using smartphones. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of this method using a real human behavior model.

We iteratively designed instruments to be used as tools primarily for citizen science practitioners seeking to understand or communicate policy impacts. We then trialled the CSISTA and associated instruments on four exemplary citizen science initiatives, using different forms of inquiry and collaboration with respective initiative leaders. In this paper, we present CSISTA, with details of the steps for implementing inquiry and storytelling instruments. Additionally, we reflect on insights gained and challenges encountered implementing the approach. Overall, we found the versatility and structure of CSISTA as a process with multiple guiding instruments useful. We envision the approach being helpful, particularly with regards to: 1) gaining an understanding of a citizen science initiative's policy and decision-making impacts; 2) creating short policy impact stories to communicate such impacts to broader audiences; or 3) fulfilling both goals to understand and communicate policy impacts with a unified approach. We encourage others to explore, adapt, and improve the approach. Additionally, we hope that explorations of CSISTA will foster broader discussions on how to understand and strengthen interactions between citizen science practitioners, policy makers, and decision makers at large, whether at local, national, or international scales.

However, it has the potential to be a useful tool in other disciplines such as health. The aim of this study was to identify the factors for involvement (or non-involvement) in health-related citizen science projects using the Our Outdoors citizen science initiative as an example. Our Outdoors aims to understand how urban and rural shared outdoors spaces (e.g., parks, lakes, rivers, beaches) can affect human health and well-being (both positively and negatively). Understanding the motivations for involvement in such a program is likely to be useful for increasing participation rates and involvement. Qualitative research methods were used in this study in which semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 participants from two community projects in Scotland, United Kingdom. A thematic analysis revealed five key themes pertaining to the factors that motivated engagement with health-related citizen science projects such as Our Outdoors. These include enhancing social connectedness; personal learning development; making a difference in the community; gaining health and well-being benefits; and finally, demotivating factors relating to time constraints and the term "citizen science". This study concludes that emphasising motivating factors in the promotional material for health-related citizen science projects may increase recruitment and the active involvement of participants. Similarly, reducing the presence of demotivating factors and considering the use of the term "citizen science" is likely to encourage participation	[Lehman, Elizabeth; Archibald, Daryll] La Trobe Univ, Sch Psychol & Publ Hlth, Plenty Rd & Kingsbury Dr, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia; [Jepson, Ruth] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Hlth Social Sci, 5 Forest Hill, Edinburgh EH1 2QL, Midlothian, Scotland; [McAteer, John] 23-5 Hopetoun Crescent, Edinburgh EH7 4AY, Midlothian, Scotland; [Archibald, Daryll] Univ Dundee, Sch Hlth Sci, 11 Airlie Pl, Dundee DD1 4HJ, Scotland	La Trobe University; University of Edinburgh; University of Dundee	Lehman, E (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Sch Psychol & Publ Hlth, Plenty Rd & Kingsbury Dr, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.	e.lehman@latrobe.edu.au; ruth.jepson@ed.ac.uk; john.mcateer77@gmail.com; darchibald001@dundee.ac.uk		Lehman, Elizabeth/0000-0002-9328-6268	La Trobe University	La Trobe University	This research received no external funding.

J	De Cristofaro, E; Soriente, C				De Cristofaro, Emiliano; Soriente, Claudio			Extended Capabilities for a Privacy-Enhanced Participatory Sensing Infrastructure (PEPSI)	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Privacy; security; participatory sensing	SECURITY; OPTIMIZATION; ENCRYPTION; SYSTEMS; NETWORK	Participatory sensing is emerging as an innovative computing paradigm that targets the ubiquity of always-connected mobile phones and their sensing capabilities. In this paper, a multitude of pioneering applications increasingly carry out pervasive collection and dissemination of information and environmental data, such as traffic conditions, pollution, temperature, and so on. Participants collect and report measurements from their mobile devices and entrust them to the cloud to be made available to applications and users. Naturally, due to the personal information associated to the reports ( e. g., location, movements, etc.), a number of privacy concerns need to be considered prior to a large-scale deployment of these applications. Motivated by the need for privacy protection in participatory sensing, this paper presents a privacy-enhanced participatory sensing infrastructure. We explore realistic architectural assumptions and a minimal set of formal requirements aiming at protecting privacy of both data producers and consumers. We propose two instantiations that attain privacy guarantees with provable security at very low additional computational cost and almost no extra communication overhead.

Participatory Modeling in Support of Citizen Science Research <i>Comment</i>	FORESTS			English	Editorial Material						participatory modeling; social-ecological systems; social learning	ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; VOLUNTEER; SENSE	Stakeholder engagement and participation is often an essential ingredient for successful environmental conservation and management. Including stakeholders in participatory environmental research has been an increasingly recognized necessity for understanding the complex nature of social-ecological systems (SES). The public is also essential to help structure environmental problems and decide on management interventions. As a result, new inclusive approaches to scientific research have emerged, such as Citizen Science. While there have been many climate change-related citizen science projects, in this paper, we provide an overview of a specific type of citizen science project. More specifically, we describe a participatory modeling approach to citizen science which can support climate change research.

PyMW is intended to support rapid development, testing and deployment of large scale master-worker style computations on a desktop grid or volunteer computing environment. This module targets nonexpert computer users by hiding complicated task submission and result retrieval procedures behind a simple interface. PyMW also provides a unified interface to multiple computing environments with easy extension to support additional environments. In this paper, we describe the internal structure and external interface to the PyMW module and its support for the Condor computing environment and the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) platform. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of PyMW by performing master-worker style computations on a desktop grid using Condor and a BOINC volunteer computing project.

Emerging research in urban land teleconnections highlights the benefits of incorporating theoretical insights from political ecology and participatory action research. Reviewing some of the forces propelling the recent popularity of citizen science, this article outlines challenges to processes of collaboration between scientists and non-scientists. We distinguish these concerns from others that may arise from the data or other products resulting from citizen science projects. Careful consideration of the processes and products of citizen science could engender a more fruitful relationship between professional scientists and their research communities and help universities to build effective partnerships with those in wider society whose expertise comes from their life experience.

Enhancing the health and wellbeing benefits of biodiversity citizen science	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						community-led; cobenefits; health intervention; nature-based solutions; conservation; human-nature interaction; community engagement	CONSERVATION; CONFLICT	Engagement in biodiversity citizen science initiatives can confer health and wellbeing benefits to individuals and communities. Yet, few biodiversity citizen science initiatives are explicitly planned to optimize health and wellbeing as a potential co-benefit, leading to missed opportunities for biodiversity conservation and human health. In this perspective, we use a dose-response approach to discuss the components that determine how engagement in biodiversity citizen science initiatives map onto opportunities to foster health and wellbeing benefits. We considered aspects related to the duration and frequency of contact with nature, and the intensity of interactions with nature and between individuals to highlight the different health benefits across the variety of citizen science initiatives. To illustrate these aspects, we use a sample of 95 citizen science initiatives from seven English and non-English-speaking countries and show how careful project design can increase the potential to confer health and wellbeing benefits to participants. We conclude with considerations on how to enhance the health and wellbeing benefits from citizen science initiatives, and propose potential research avenues to assess synergies and trade-offs between benefits to biodiversity and human health from these initiatives.

Digitally enabled methods can extend the potential of citizen science by enabling citizens to engage in real-time research processes, such as data collection, information sharing, interpreting, acting on data, and informing decision-making. However, the power of any citizen science lies in promoting health equity by providing equal opportunity for citizen engagement. Without appropriate attention to recognize and address equity, digital enablement of citizen science may exacerbate rather than ameliorate health inequalities. In this Viewpoint, we draw on our digital health research experience and perspectives to outline the practice of citizen science in the context of digital health-how it is operationalized, key advocated principles, and challenges. We also discuss citizen science in relation to health equity and implementation science, including emphasizing the importance of integrating health equity principles and frameworks, health equity implementation determinants, and digital determinants of health. We demonstrate how equity could be achieved by providing a working example in the context of a digitally enabled approach to improving social, physical, and mental well-being among peoplewith disability andcaregivers.

A crucial question in this respect however is, whether democratisation of access to research in terms of reaching and involving diverse citizens actually takes place in citizen science projects. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the case. The EU funded project Reinforce adheres to principles of inclusiveness and monitors and evaluates whether these principles are being met. Safeguarding that citizen science projects are inclusive means addressing technical as well as psychological and sociological aspects. On the technical side, in order for people with visual impairments to participate, the Reinforce Citizen Science projects, which are implemented on the Zooniverse platform, have to be made accessible. The software SonoUno has been developed to transform images into sound signals. A second strand for reaching diverse target groups is the participatory engagement strategy of the project. The applied evaluation process systematically targets quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the inclusivity approach of the project. The paper seeks to discuss the inclusivity aspect of citizen science projects in general, to then describe the project Reinforce with its strategies to make citizen scientists projects more inclusive especially for people with visual impairments, technically, psychologically and sociologically. Furthermore, we will share the evaluation framework that has been elaborated to monitor the diversity of participants and inclusivity of the citizen science projects.

The potential of citizen science to transform science: Lessons for a sustainable future	PEOPLE AND NATURE			English	Article						citizen science; sustainability transitions; transformative potential	KNOWLEDGE; TRANSITIONS; TOOL	Globally, environmental crises are at a critical point. Findings from scientific research are crucial to understand these issues and to inform new policies to address them. Yet the rapidity with which society, industry and lifestyles are changing is not matched in dynamism by institutionalised science, where institutional structures slow the rate of adaptation. In this paper, we propose that citizen science can act as a bridge between the ideal and the reality of scientific research, structuring the interface of scientific research with its cultural context. In so doing, citizen science can increase science's ability to address complex ecological problems where data is needed alongside public and policy engagement. As part of a wider movement of informal scientific practices, citizen science can broaden institutionalised science's horizon, foster innovation and create more impact. Drawing on examples of citizen science practice addressing pollution, we specify ways in which citizen science can provide embedded knowledge and foster alternative practices within the sciences. We identify a clash of logics between citizen science and institutional science practice and suggest avenues that could be pursued to improve dialogue between the two.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

J	Guler, H; Cambazoglu, BB; Ozkasap, O				Guler, Huseyin; Barla Cambazoglu, B.; Ozkasap, Oznur			Task allocation in volunteer computing networks under monetary budget constraints	PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Volunteer computing network; Electricity market; Optimization; Heuristics		In volunteer computing networks, the peers contribute to the solution of a computationally intensive problem by freely providing their computational resources, i.e., without seeking any immediate financial benefit. In such networks, although the peers can set certain bounds on how much their resources can be exploited by the network, the monetary cost that the network brings to the peers is unclear. In this work, we propose a volunteer computing network where the peers can set monetary budgets, limiting the financial burden incurred on them due the usage of their computational resources. Under the assumption that the price of the electricity consumed by the peers has temporal variation, we show that our approach leads to an interesting task allocation problem, where the goal is to maximize the amount of work done by the peers without violating the monetary budget constraints set by them. We propose various heuristics as solution to the problem, which is NP-hard. Our extensive simulations using realistic data traces and real-life electricity prices demonstrate that the proposed techniques considerably increase the amount of useful work done by the peers, compared to a baseline technique.

Since it is very hard to be researched in a common way by observing the real word, simulation is a powerful means for this research. Compared with other large scale interactive simulations, simulation for crowd science owes features of dynamic, diversification and massive participants. Fortunately, as the most famous and widely accepted standard, HLA has been widely used in large scale simulations. But when it comes to crowd science, HLA has shortcomings like federation fixed, scale limited and agreement outside the software system. This paper proposes a novel HLA based framework for crowd science simulations. The proposed framework adopts a two level federation based architecture, which separates simulation related environments into physical and logical aspect to enhance the flexibility of simulations. Simulation definition is introduced in this architecture to resolve the problem of outside agreements and shared resources pool is used to address the systemic emergence and scale problem. In the end, an implementation architecture demonstrates the feasibility of proposed architecture.

J	Tham, CK; Luo, T				Tham, Chen-Khong; Luo, Tie			Quality of Contributed Service and Market Equilibrium for Participatory Sensing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Mobile computing; participatory sensing; network economics; incentive		User-contributed or crowd-sourced information is becoming increasingly common. In this paper, we consider the specific case of participatory sensing whereby people contribute information captured by sensors, typically those on a smartphone, and share the information with others. We propose a new metric called quality of contributed service (QCS) which characterizes the information quality and timeliness of a specific real-time sensed quantity achieved in a participatory manner. Participatory sensing has the problem that contributions are sporadic and infrequent. To overcome this, we formulate a market-based framework for participatory sensing with plausible models of the market participants comprising data contributors, service consumers and a service provider. We analyze the market equilibrium and obtain a closed form expression for the resulting QCS at market equilibrium. Next, we examine the effects of realistic behaviors of the market participants and the nature of the market equilibrium that emerges through extensive simulations. Our results show that, starting from purely random behavior, the market and its participants can converge to the market equilibrium with good QCS within a short period of time.

A Survey of Incentive Mechanisms for Participatory Sensing	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS			English	Article						Participatory sensing; incentive schemes; survey	REPUTATION SYSTEM; FRAMEWORK; ANONYMITY; PROTOCOLS; DESIGN	Participatory sensing is now becoming more popular and has shown its great potential in various applications. It was originally proposed to recruit ordinary citizens to collect and share massive amounts of sensory data using their portable smart devices. By attracting participants and paying rewards as a return, incentive mechanisms play an important role to guarantee a stable scale of participants and to improve the accuracy/coverage/timeliness of the sensing results. Along this direction, a considerable amount of research activities have been conducted recently, ranging from experimental studies to theoretical solutions and practical applications, aiming at providing more comprehensive incentive procedures and/or protecting benefits of different system stakeholders. To this end, this paper surveys the literature over the period of 2004-2014 from the state of the art of theoretical frameworks, applications and system implementations, and experimental studies of the incentive strategies used in participatory sensing by providing up-to-date research in the literature. We also point out future directions of incentive strategies used in participatory sensing.

To evaluate the recent trends, challenges and opportunities of utilizing citizen science in ecosystem service studies we conducted a systematic literature and project review. We reviewed the range of ecosystem services and formats of participation in citizen science in 17 peer-reviewed scientific publications and 102 ongoing or finished citizen science projects, out of over 500 screened publications and over 1400 screened projects. We found that citizen science is predominantly applied in assessing regulating and cultural services. The assessments were often performed by using proxy indicators that only implicitly provide information on ecosystem services. Direct assessments of ecosystem services are still rare. Participation formats mostly comprise contributory citizen science projects that focus on volunteered data collection. However, there is potential to increase citizen involvement in comprehensive ecosystem service assessments, including the development of research questions, design, data analysis and dissemination of findings. Levels of involvement could be enhanced to strengthen strategic knowledge on the environment, scientific literacy and the empowerment of citizens in helping to inform and monitor policies and management efforts related to ecosystem services. We provide an outlook how to better operationalise citizen science approaches to assess ecosystem services. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It can achieve unprecedented quantity of data. However, it is arduous to guarantee quality of data because everyone can contribute data without scrutinization. It is an important issue in quality-oriented participatory sensing. Our idea to address this issue is motivating participants to contribute accurate data for improving data quality directly. In this article, we propose a reputation-based incentive mechanism, RIM, to realize the idea. More specifically, we identify the participants who collect the accurate data and regard them as the reputable ones. Then, the reputable participants are granted a higher chance to obtain rewards so that other people will try to follow such users and become reputable as well. Namely, RIM can encourage and steer users to collect accurate data in the long term. We analyze our incentive mechanism by formalization and premise implications. For a feasibility study of participatory sensing and verification of the implications, we implement and deploy a participatory sensing application focusing on monitoring environmental noise in a specific location as a case study and conduct a simulation based on the case study to further evaluate the proposed incentive mechanism. The results from the case study and the simulation present that RIM can remarkably increase the quality of collected data in participatory sensing while corroborating our theoretical implications.

J	Dhillon, CM				Dhillon, Carla May			Using citizen science in environmental justice: participation and decision-making in a Southern California waste facility siting conflict	LOCAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Environmental justice; citizen science; public participation; community capacity; theories of justice	AIR TOXICS; CONTAMINATION; SIDE	Uses of science by environmental justice (EJ) activists reflect struggles to challenge professional scientific expertise, achieve fair outcomes, and effectively participate in decision-making processes. This qualitative research analyses the relationship between citizen science and EJ in a new waste facility siting conflict in urban Los Angeles, namely connections between citizen science and four dimensions of EJ: fair distribution, respect and recognition, participation in decision-making, and community capabilities. Citizen science is one tactic in EJ, yet little research investigates its role in a new facility siting conflict, particularly in relation to multi-faceted EJ goals. The research reveals opportunities for individual empowerment and community capacity building using citizen science, and a small measure of improved respect and recognition for participants who brought their own knowledge, research, and voices to the table. At the same time, the work identifies limitations on citizen science to improve local participatory procedures and decision-making, which also constricted the achievement of outcomes most desired by the EJ group: to prevent approval and construction of the new waste facility. This paper argues that uses of citizen science contributed to partial achievement of EJ goals, while hindered by governance processes that call for public participation yet shield decision-makers from substantive engagement with the volume or content of that participation.

Yet the data and knowledge generated and the possibilities for engaging citizens have grown significantly in the last decades thanks to the recent developments in mobile technologies and the access to internet, resulting in a transformation of how environmental protection can be done. This perspective provides some examples on how European EPAs and their partners are currently addressing key environmental challenges and exploring new institutional approaches by bringing in citizen science data and methods. It also points out challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of citizen science as a complement to the monitoring efforts by these agencies. Finally, it presents the Interest Group on Citizen Science of the Network of the Heads of Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA Network), an informal forum where EPAs across Europe share examples and bring together strategic insights on citizen science approaches into their daily activities.

J	Cheung, W; Feldman, D				Cheung, Wing; Feldman, David			Can Citizen Science Promote Flood Risk Communication?	WATER			English	Article						participation; citizen science; flood; risk management; risk communication	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; PARTICIPATION; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; POLITICS; TOOL; GIS	This article explores the challenges facing citizen science as a means of joining the efforts of scientists and flood-risk affected stakeholders in motivating citizen involvement in identifying and mitigating flood risks. While citizen science harbors many advantages, including a penchant for collaborative research and the ability to motivate those affected by floods to work with scientists in elucidating and averting risk, it is not without challenges in its implementation. These include ensuring that scientists are willing to share authority with amateur citizen scientists, providing forums that encourage debate, and encouraging equal voice in developing flood risk mitigation strategies. We assess these challenges by noting the limited application of citizen science to flood-relevant problems in existing research and recommend future research in this area to meaningfully incorporate a "re-imagined" citizen science process that is based on the participatory theoretical framework. We also discuss one case study where the principles of collaboration, debate, and equal voice were put into play in an effort to apply citizen science and-in the long term-mitigate flood hazards in one set of communities.

J	Hecht, J; Rice, ES				Hecht, Julie; Rice, Eleanor Spicer			Citizen science: A new direction in canine behavior research	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES			English	Article						Cognition; Data quality; Dog; Public participation	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; DOGS; PERSONALITY; FAMILIARIS; TOOL; VALIDATION; KNOWLEDGE; CHOICE; QUESTIONNAIRE; CONSERVATION	Researchers increasingly rely on members of the public to contribute to scientific projects from collecting or identifying, to analyzing and disseminating data. The "citizen science" model proves useful to many thematically distinctive fields, like ornithology, astronomy, and phenology. The recent formalization of citizen science projects addresses technical issues related to volunteer participation like data quality so that citizen scientists can make longstanding, meaningful contributions to scientific projects. Since the late 1990s, canine science research has relied with greater frequency on the participation of the general public, particularly dog owners. These researchers do not typically consider the methods and technical issues that those conducting citizen science projects embrace and continue to investigate. As more canine science studies rely on public input, an in-depth knowledge of the benefits and challenges of citizen science can help produce relevant, high-quality data while increasing the general public's understanding of canine behavior and cognition as well as the scientific process. We examine the benefits and challenges of current citizen science models in an effort to enhance canine citizen science project preparation, execution, and dissemination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

'My new routine': Assessing the impact of citizen science on climate adaptation in Bangladesh	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Citizen science; Climate adaptation; Governance assessment; Bangladesh	ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; AGENCY; COMANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; SYSTEMS; TOOL	Citizen science is put forward as a method for extending science to include communities in learning about, and adapting to, climate variability and change in the places they live. But it is difficult to find evidence of how citizen science influences climate adaptation governance. The citizen science field lacks the assessment frameworks and empirical studies for understanding impacts on citizen scientists' common adaptive capacities for supporting social processes of adaptation. In addressing this gap, this paper describes a citizen science initiative carried out with communities in northeast Bangladesh, and assesses how it contributed to local governance capacity for climate adaptation. In doing so, it develops and tests a novel framework that assesses citizen science's contributions a high-quality knowledge base, and to five different capital stocks. The assessment saw high increases in citizen scientists' human capital relative to their awareness and understanding of local rainfall; learning that they applied in adaptive practices at work and at home, and local leadership. There were also high increases in social capital among citizen scientists, but more moderate increases in technological and resource capital, and in political capital. There was some evidence of the citizen science being used to support public adaptation decision-making. The initiative had the least impact on institutional capital.

Citizen science adds new collaborators whose contributions help to gather or analyse data on a large scale particularly relevant for emerging questions about the distribution and abundance of organisms across space and time. Syngnathids are cryptic fishes that inhabits temperate and tropical sheltered, coastal marine waters. Pipefishes and seahorses are threatened by habitat loss and degradation. Unfortunately, data on biological and ecological aspects and population trends are rarely available in most species. More than half of the thirteen-syngnathid species inhabiting Spanish coasts are considered Data Deficient for population evaluation. Citizen science is an opportunity to improve data availability for the study of syngnathid population tendencies and monitoring. This contribution describes and discusses the approach followed by Sea Watchers citizen science platform. We analysed and discussed the data provided by the observers, and the distribution data of species based on citizen science surveillance. Citizen science achieved the expansion of spatial and temporal dataset of syngnathid distribution. However, the obtained information is affected by observers' behaviour and suggest that the observers performed focussed surveys to find individuals of these slow motion iconic fishes, introducing biases in the data.

L.; Sawyers, Emma; Campbell, Susan; Matthews, John; Elsworth, Peter			The impact of RHDV-K<i>5</i> on rabbit populations in Australia: an evaluation of citizen science surveys to monitor rabbit abundance	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BIAS	The increasing popularity of citizen science in ecological research has created opportunities for data collection from large teams of observers that are widely dispersed. We established a citizen science program to complement the release of a new variant of the rabbit biological control agent, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), known colloquially as K5, across Australia. We evaluated the impact of K5 on the national rabbit population and compared citizen science and professionally-collected spotlight count data. Of the citizen science sites (n = 219), 93% indicated a decrease in rabbit abundance following the release of K5. The overall finite monthly growth rate in rabbit abundance was estimated as 0.66 (95%CI, 0.26, 1.03), averaging a monthly reduction of 34% at the citizen science sites one month after the release. No such declines were observed at the professionally monitored sites (n = 22). The citizen science data submissions may have been unconsciously biased or the number of professional sites may have been insufficient to detect a change. Citizen science participation also declined by 56% over the post-release period. Future programs should ensure the use of blinded trials to check for unconscious bias and consider how incentives and/or the good will of the participants can be maintained throughout the program.

Citizen science engages target groups in the design and execution of health interventions, but has not yet been applied in an occupational setting. This preliminary study determines barriers and facilitators and feasible elements for citizen science to improve the health of blue-collar workers. The study was conducted in a terminal and construction company by performing semi-structured interviews and focus groups with employees, company management and experts. Interviews and focus groups were analyzed using thematic content analysis and the elements were pilot tested. Workers considered work pressure, work location and several personal factors as barriers for citizen science at the worksite, and (lack of) social support and (negative) social culture both as barriers and facilitators. Citizen science to improve health at the worksite may include three elements: (1) knowledge and skills, (2) social support and social culture, and (3) awareness about lifestyle behaviors. Strategies to implement these elements may be company specific. This study provides relevant indications on feasible elements and strategies for citizen science to improve health at the worksite. Further studies on the feasibility of citizen science in other settings, including a larger and more heterogeneous sample of blue-collar workers, are necessary.

While most citizen science projects take place within problem-focused natural sciences, social sciences and humanities help understanding the human dimension and open a broad methodological spectrum for enriching scientific research with new approaches and for boosting public participation. In this paper, we use a meta-synthesis approach to explore how citizen science is practised in the so far less addressed social sciences and humanities by focusing on the role of the citizens, the goals and approaches of the projects, the tasks in which citizens are engaged and their gains across projects of diverse disciplinary background. Our findings indicate that social sciences are gaining more acknowledgment within interdisciplinary citizen science projects by addressing 'wicked' problems of human behaviour and agency, while humanities are in quest of a better-defined locus in citizen science. We conclude that social sciences and humanities still face considerable barriers to infiltrate citizen science; the payoffs are substantial and already rewarding for several subfields in social sciences and humanities.

J	Ottinger, G				Ottinger, Gwen			Buckets of Resistance: Standards and the Effectiveness of Citizen Science	SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES			English	Article						standards; citizen science; environmental justice; air quality monitoring; democratizing science	REGULATORY SCIENCE; POLITICS; BIOTECHNOLOGY; UNIVERSALITY; ORGANIZATION; GOVERNANCE	In light of arguments that citizen science has the potential to make environmental knowledge and policy more robust and democratic, this article inquires into the factors that shape the ability of citizen science to actually influence scientists and decision makers. Using the case of community-based air toxics monitoring with ''buckets,'' it argues that citizen science's effectiveness is significantly influenced by standards and standardized practices. It demonstrates that, on one hand, standards serve a boundary-bridging function that affords bucket monitoring data a crucial measure of legitimacy among experts. On the other hand, standards simultaneously serve a boundary-policing function, allowing experts to dismiss bucket data as irrelevant to the central project of air quality assessment. The article thus calls attention to standard setting as an important site of intervention for citizen science-based efforts to democratize science and policy.

Sadly, processing resources assigned to the corresponding Folding@home project cannot be shared with other volunteer computing projects efficiently. Consequently, the largest supercomputer had significant idle times. This perspective paper investigates how the resource sharing of future volunteer computing projects could be improved. Notably, efficient resource sharing has been optimized throughout the last ten years in cloud computing. Therefore, this perspective paper reviews the current state of volunteer and cloud computing to analyze what both domains could learn from each other. It turns out that the disclosed resource sharing shortcomings of volunteer computing could be addressed by technologies that have been invented, optimized, and adapted for entirely different purposes by cloud-native companies like Uber, Airbnb, Google, or Facebook. Promising technologies might be containers, serverless architectures, image registries, distributed service registries, and all have one thing in common: They already exist and are all tried and tested in large web-scale deployments.

We focus on the changing approaches to science, research and development related to the turn to openness and transparency, which has made science more open and inclusive, even for non-researchers. Reproducible and collaborative research, which is driven by the open access principles, involves citizens in many research fields. The article shows how international support is pushing citizen science forward, and how citizens' involvement is becoming more important. A basic scientometric analysis (based on the Web of Science Core Collection as the source of peer reviewed articles) provides a first insight into the diffusion of the citizen science concept in the field of Geography, mapping the growth of citizen science articles over time, the spectrum of geographical journals that publish them, and their citation rate compared to other scientific disciplines. The authors also discuss future challenges of citizen science and its potential, which for the time being seems to be not fully utilized in some fields, including geographical research.

It plays a vital role in democratizing science, providing equitable access to scientific participation and data, helps build the capacity of its participants, inculcates the spirit of scientific endeavor and discovery and sensitizes participants towards species and habitat conservation, creating a sense of stewardship towards nature. In recent years, citizen science, especially in biodiversity, has rapidly developed with the rising popularity of smartphones, and widespread access to the internet, leading to wider adoption globally. India has also witnessed a surge in the number of new citizen science projects being initiated and increased participation in these projects. With more proponents looking at initiating such projects, there is little documentation from an Indian perspective on setting up, collecting, managing, and maintaining biodiversity-focused citizen science projects, especially in a data-management context. We have attempted to fill this void by examining the best practices across the data life cycle of citizen science projects while keeping in mind sensitivities and scenarios in India. We hope this will prove to be an important reference for citizen science practitioners looking to better manage their data in their projects.

However, concerns have been raised about potential biases in these new datasets. We aimed to test whether citizen science bird databases have more biases than professional scientific databases. Our hypotheses were 1) citizen science databases will have more data on "easy to spot" species, that are widely distributed and have large body sizes; whereas 2) professional databases will have more endangered species and species of special interest for research. We analysed six Spanish bird databases: three professional, two citizen science and one mixed database. Our results show that, in general, occurrences in citizen science databases are better explained by the studied variables than professional databases, but no clear differences were found when analysed individually. Both citizen science and professional databases contain invaluable information on biodiversity but every database comes with a particular history and its stored data is the result of years of field sampling with heterogeneous goals, sampling methods and sampling effort. Consequently, raw observations should not be used directly as an ideal survey of the distribution or abundance of birds. We need to uncover these biases and develop new methods to properly incorporate the extensive and heterogeneous biodiversity data that is readily available to research.

The low barriers of entry and well-established methods of participatory monitoring have potential to enable community participant involvement in applications of nature-based solutions (NbS). However, a better understanding of the current state of community-based approaches within NbS could improve feasibility for researchers and practitioners to implement community-based approaches in NbS. Based on the current literature, we discern five community science approaches that support NbS: (1) Environmental monitoring to determine baseline conditions; (2) Involvement of participants in NbS development and planning through discussions and workshops (i.e., co-design of NbS); (3) Using existing CS databases to support NbS design and implementation; (4) Determining the impacts and measuring effectiveness of NbS; and (5) Participation in multifunctional activities. While there are various avenues of participation, we find that CS-driven environmental monitoring (i.e., actions that involve observing, measuring, and assessing environmental parameters and conditions over time) emerges as a cornerstone of planning, implementing, and maintaining the success of NbS. As the proliferation of NbS implementation continues, future work to integrate community-based monitoring studies in NbS applications has potential, albeit far from guaranteed, to improve place-based and local societal and ecological outcomes.

Using agency as a lens for understanding teachers' practices when using this approach is important. In this ethnographic case study, a teacher implementing a citizen science education program using Arduino was investigated from an ecological approach using temporal and relational dimensions of agency. In the iterational dimension, the teacher's own experiences and traits from life and professional histories were identified. His identity as a teacher and his religious values formed the projective dimension. Encouraging administrators, the financial difficulties of the school, and the COVID-19 pandemic were major elements of the practical-evaluative dimension. Findings reveal the complex array of the teacher's agency in the context of implementing citizen science education with Arduino with students, which contributes new understandings about science teacher agency.

Despite the profusion of citizen science projects in conservation, many lacked a coherent analytical framework for understanding broad-scale transnational human-species interactions. The telecoupling framework provides a means to overcome this limitation. In this study, we use the monarch butterfly, a migratory species of high conservation value, to illustrate how citizen science data can be utilized in telecoupling research to help inform conservation decisions. We also address the challenges and limitations of this approach and provide recommendations on the future direction of citizen-based projects to overcome these challenges. The integration of citizen-based science and the telecoupling framework can become the new frontier in conservation because the applications of citizen science data in distant human-environment relationships have rarely been explored, especially from coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) perspectives.

J	Field-Juma, A; Roberts-Lawler, N				Field-Juma, Alison; Roberts-Lawler, Nancy			Using Partnerships and Community Science to Protect Wild and Scenic Rivers in the Eastern United States	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						citizen science; Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; community science; dam removal; NPDES; water quality monitoring; Clean Water Act		The Musconetcong (New Jersey) and the Sudbury-Assabet-Concord (Massachusetts) are federally-designated Partnership Wild and Scenic Rivers, a model for river conservation under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. These two rivers are embedded in a patchwork of private and public land ownership. The Act has been used to facilitate partnerships among municipal, state, federal and local non-profit actors to implement river conservation plans. These partnerships have supported community science-based monitoring to make the case for dam removal and stricter water pollution controls. Two case studies examine using community science to provide actionable data to decision-makers. In New Jersey, a documented increase in macroinvertebrates post-dam removal supported additional dam removals, leading to the return of American shad to the river. Quality controls and training proved to be key components. In Massachusetts, stricter effluent discharge permits reduced instream Total Phosphorus from 0.8 mg/L in 1999 to the eutrophication threshold of 0.023-0.05 mg/L. Community engagement in river science and stewardship was an important co-benefit. As many US rivers evolve from generating hydropower and conveying waste into major recreational resources, local organizations are uniquely positioned to engage the public and generate quality-controlled data to use in advocating for major improvements in water and habitat quality. Useful policy and regulatory frameworks for broader applicability are suggested.

Where civics meets science: building science for the public good through Civic Science	ORAL DISEASES			English	Review						Civic Science; civic engagement; citizenship; democracy; science education	TRUST	Public understanding of science and civic engagement on science issues that impact contemporary life matter more today than ever. From the Planned Parenthood controversy, to the Flint water crisis and the fluoridation debate, societal polarization about science issues has reached dramatic levels that present significant obstacles to public discussion and problem solving. This is happening, in part, because systems built to support science do not often reward open-minded thinking, inclusive dialogue, and moral responsibility regarding science issues. As a result, public faith in science continues to erode. This review explores how the field of Civic Science can impact public work on science issues by building new understanding of the practices, influences, and cultures of science. Civic Science is defined as a discipline that considers science practice and knowledge as resources for civic engagement, democratic action, and political change. This review considers how Civic Science informs the roles that key participants-scientists, public citizens and institutions of higher education-play in our national science dialogue. Civic Science aspires to teach civic capacities, to inform the responsibilities of scientists engaged in public science issues and to inspire an open-minded, inclusive dialogue where all voices are heard and shared commitments are acknowledged.

We used observational data from two community science efforts and an estimate of urban land cover in each block to develop an index of urban association, and then modeled the relationship between species occurrence and eight traits likely associated with urban tolerance. We found two traits to be significantly associated with urbanization in both eras: Structure-nesting (i.e., the tendency to build nests on human-built structures) was positively associated, and cavity-nesting (i.e., the tendency to build nests in natural tree cavities) was negatively associated. Our analysis provides a template for mining historical community science data, and for "retrofitting" contemporary data to gain insights into ecological trends over time, and illustrates the persistence of ecological traits of species associated with urban areas even as the makeup of these species communities may change.

Evaluating the Fitness for Use of Citizen Science Data for Wildlife Monitoring	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						volunteered geographic information; data fitness; data quality; ecological monitoring; citizen science	VOLUNTEERED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SPATIAL DATA; ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; QUALITY; KNOWLEDGE; PATTERNS; TOOL	Contributory citizen science programs focused on ecological monitoring can produce fine-grained and expansive data sets across spatial and temporal scales. With this data collection potential, citizen scientists can significantly impact the ability to monitor ecological patterns. However, scientists still harbor skepticism about using citizen science data in their work, generally due to doubts about data quality. Numerous peer-reviewed articles have addressed data quality in citizen science. Yet, many of these methods are not useable by third-party scientists (scientists who are not directly involved in the citizen science program). In addition, these methods generally capture internal data quality rather than a dataset's potential to be used for a specific purpose. Assessing data fitness for use represents a promising approach to evaluating data accuracy and quality for different applications and contexts. In this article, we employ a Spatial, Temporal, Aptness, and Application (STAAq) assessment approach to assess data fitness for use of citizen science datasets. We tested the STAAq assessment approach through a case study examining the distribution of caribou in Denali National Park and Preserve. Three different datasets were used in the test, Map of Life data (a global scale citizen science mobile application for recording species observations), Ride Observe and Record data (a program sponsored by the park staff where incentivized volunteers observe species in the park), and conventionally collected radio collar data. The STAAq assessment showed that the Map of Life and Ride Observe and Record program data are fit for monitoring caribou distribution in the park. This data fitness for use approach is a promising way to assess the external quality of a dataset and its fitness to address particular research or monitoring questions. This type of assessment may help citizen science skeptics see the value and potential of citizen science collected data and encourage the use of citizen science data by more scientists.

Andrew			Leveraging community science data for population assessments during a pandemic	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						eBird; generalized additive model; integrated model; Louisiana; Mottled Ducks; Texas; western Gulf Coast	CITIZEN SCIENCE; UNITED-STATES; MODELS; HABITAT; DENSITY; TRENDS	The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted field research programs, making conservation and management decision-making more challenging. However, it may be possible to conduct population assessments using integrated models that combine community science data with existing data from structured surveys. We developed a space-time integrated model to characterize spatial and temporal variability in population distribution. We fit our integrated model to 10 years of eBird (2010-2020) and 9 years of aerial survey (2010-2019) Mottled Duck count data to forecast 2020 population size along the western Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. Estimates of Mottled Duck abundance were similar in magnitude to estimates calculated using previous methods but were more precise and showed evidence of a declining population. The spatial distribution for Mottled Ducks each year was characterized by several concentrations of relatively high abundance, although the location of these abundance "hotspots" varied over time. Expected abundance was higher for areas with a higher proportion of area covered by marsh habitat. By leveraging large-scale community science data, we were able to conduct a population assessment despite the disruption in structured surveys caused by the pandemic. As participation in community science platforms continues to increase, we anticipate modeling frameworks, like the integrated model we developed here, will become increasingly useful for informing conservation and management decision-making.

However, there is a lack of a common theoretical framework for recruitment and most projects rely on intuition or trial-and-error to develop their engagement strategies. Effective citizen science engagement needs theoretical participation frameworks and the concurrent action of different engagement roles to implement the framework. Besides, we must consider the various short-term and long-term engagement needs of the communities involved in the project. Furthermore, citizen science platforms are evolving towards infrastructures with technical but also social components to ensure long-term engagement. In this study, we have developed and tested an engagement framework for environmental citizen science projects using a novel approach that combines strategies and theoretical models that have proven efficient in other disciplines, such as human behaviour change and persuasion. Our framework is based on four interconnected pillars that feed each other: theoretical engagement models for behavioural change; social design for citizen science platforms; strategies for maintaining volunteer motivation; and strategies to increment the volunteers' ability. The combination of these four pillars results in a framework that integrates both short-term and long-term interaction mechanisms. This multi-temporal approach ensures keeping volunteers motivated and engaged for long periods, a requirement for many citizen science-monitoring programs. In addition, the theoretical framework points out the benefits of considering citizen science projects as a collaboration between multiple stakeholders to ensure long-term engagement. These stakeholders include the volunteers, but also new roles such as enabling communities that act as a bridge between volunteers and academia. Specifically, we have successfully tested this framework in a marine citizen science case study that monitors urban beaches. Furthermore, together with the proposed framework, we provide specific guidelines to help managers to design tailored strategies for their citizen science projects.

Emphasising data collection as the primary objective, the findings revealed a secondary focus on environmental awareness, protection, and management, as well as education and research advancement. Notably, educational goals were often not prioritised, and formal measures for assessing learning outcomes were infrequently employed by project leaders. The study underscores the necessity for systematic approaches to evaluate the educational impacts of citizen science projects in South Africa.

However, building large HPC Clusters for this sole purpose is not always feasible or even not cost-effective since the purchasing, operational and maintenance cost of the dedicated systems is too high but they are not fully utilized in most of the time. In this regard, Volunteer Computing can address this problem as it provides a large amount of computing resources at no cost. We develop a system that expands the computing capability of HPC Clusters by using the additional computing power donated by volunteer users who would like to give the computing resources of their unused desktop computers to help execute jobs in the HPC Clusters. The proposed system can combine the native Cluster compute nodes and a set of non-dedicated compute nodes contributed by volunteers. The experiments demonstrate that the volunteer resources, such as CPU time, disk storage and GPU, can be seamlessly integrated into the HPC Clusters allowing the systems to dynamically scale up/down regarding to the amount of resources in Volunteer Computing.

In the Summer of 2020, in the middle of COVID pandemics, we started an initiative to train young students - Cyber-Cosmos - using an Unistellar eVscope, a smart, compact and user-friendly digital telescope that offers unprecedented opportunities for deep-sky observation and citizen science campaigns. Sponsored by the Ciencia Viva Summer program, this was probably the first continuous application of this equipment in a pedagogical and citizen-science context, and in a pandemic context. Pampilhosa da Serra, home to a certified Dark Sky destination (Aldeias do Xisto) in central Portugal, was the chosen location for this project, where we expect astrotourism and citizen science to flourish and contribute to space sciences education.

In this context, automatic data collection becomes important. In this study, a method is proposed for automatic recognition of information in photographs taken by participants' cell phones. The proposed method is used to obtain information such as product names and prices from store receipt images. For this purpose, information in store receipts is recognized by image processing methods using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Then, Knowledge Based Correction (KBC) algorithms in conjunction with the participatory sensing approach are used to correct inaccurate information which cannot be corrected by image processing methods. The proposed method achieves 90% word recognition accuracy and 97% character recognition accuracy.	[Ozarslan, Suleyman; Eren, P.

Climate change, young people, and the IPCC: The role of citizen science	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						Citizen science; Young people; Climate change; IPCC	INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL; CHILDREN; YOUTH; LESSONS; TOOL	This commentary suggests that undertaking citizen science research with young people has the potential to play a significant role in contributing to the IPPC and related UN research and policy processes around climate change. Further, citizen science engagement can educate and empower children and young people in and through research by involving wider communities and groups in data collection, communication, and engagement. A persuasive body of literature suggests that children and youth can be and ought to be included in citizen science projects and that young people ought to and can have a greater say in their environmental and climate lives and futures. There is acknowledgment that certain populations, including young people, have been excluded from participation in citizen science, and strategies need to be developed to be more inclusive. Moreover, through inclusion of youth, there are opportunities for intergeneration collaboration leading to potential solutions. Our commentary is a call for the IPCC to be much more open and creative in its knowledge production work and to engage young people in climate -related citizen science.

Optimizing survey conditions for Burmese python detection and removal using community science data	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article						Machine learning; Invasive species; Community science; Burmese python; Everglades; Applied ecology	MOLURUS-BIVITTATUS; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; CITIZEN SCIENCE; MANAGEMENT; FLORIDA; SNAKES	Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus) have demonstrated prolific spread and low detectability within their invasive range in Florida, USA. Consequently, programs exist which incentivize contractors to remove pythons. While surveying, contractors collect data on search effort and python captures. We examined data from South Florida Water Management District's Python Elimination Program to determine the effect of operational and environmental covariates on two measures of survey outcome: success (i.e., probability of removing at least one python) and efficiency (i.e., the number of pythons removed per survey hour). Additionally, we assessed the spatial distribution of contractor search effort and removals. Warm temperatures (> 25 degrees C) improve survey outcomes, especially when surveys occur late at night and during the wet season (May-Oct). The most efficient interval for conducting surveys occurs from 20:00 to 02:00. The spatial distribution of python removals is concentrated in four regions and coincides with contractor search effort. Our results provide insights into optimizing removal efforts for invasive Burmese pythons in Florida, which may allow for increases in removal efficiency. Moreover, this study demonstrates that community science data can be used to synthesize recommendations for invasive species removal efforts.

Community science validates climate suitability projections from ecological niche modeling	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						bioclimatic envelope model; bluebirds; citizen science; climate change; dynamic occupancy model; nuthatches; species distribution model; validation	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; BIOCLIMATE ENVELOPE MODELS; ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY; CITIZEN SCIENCE; LAND-USE; CONSERVATION STRATEGIES; EXTINCTION RISK; GRASSLAND BIRDS; RANGE SHIFTS; ABUNDANCE	Climate change poses an intensifying threat to many bird species and projections of future climate suitability provide insight into how species may shift their distributions in response. Climate suitability is characterized using ecological niche models (ENMs), which correlate species occurrence data with current environmental covariates and project future distributions using the modeled relationships together with climate predictions. Despite their widespread adoption, ENMs rely on several assumptions that are rarely validated in situ and can be highly sensitive to modeling decisions, precluding their reliability in conservation decision-making. Using data from a novel, large-scale community science program, we developed dynamic occupancy models to validate near-term climate suitability projections for bluebirds and nuthatches in summer and winter. We estimated occupancy, colonization, and extinction dynamics across species' ranges in the United States in relation to projected climate suitability in the 2020s, and used a Gibbs variable selection approach to quantify evidence of species-climate relationships. We also included a Bird Conservation Region strata-level random effect to examine among-strata variation in occupancy that may be attributable to land-use and ecoregional differences. Across species and seasons, we found strong evidence that initial occupancy and colonization were positively related to 2020 climate suitability, illustrating an independent validation of projections from ENMs across a large geographic area. Random strata effects revealed that occupancy probabilities were generally higher than average in core areas and lower than average in peripheral areas of species' ranges, and served as a first step in identifying spatial patterns of occupancy from these community science data. Our findings lend much-needed support to the use of ENM projections for addressing questions about potential climate-induced changes in species' occupancy dynamics. More broadly, our work highlights the value of community scientist observations for ground-truthing projections from statistical models and for refining our understanding of the processes shaping species' distributions under a changing climate.

Modeling of correlated resources availability in distributed computing systems	SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY			English	Article						Volunteer computing; Resource availability; Statistical modeling; Markov model; Time series	TIME-SERIES; UNIT-ROOT; ESTIMATORS; FIT	Volunteer computing systems are large-scale distributed systems with large number of heterogeneous and unreliable Internet-connected hosts. Volunteer computing resources are suitable mainly to run High-Throughput Computing (HTC) applications due to their unavailability rate and frequent churn. Although they provide Peta-scale computing power for many scientific projects across the globe, efficient usage of this platform for different types of applications still has not been investigated in depth. So, characterizing, analyzing and modeling such resources availability in volunteer computing is becoming essential and important for efficient application scheduling. In this paper, we focus on statistical modeling of volunteer resources, which exhibit non-random pattern in their availability time. The proposed models take into account the autocorrelation structure in individual and subset of hosts whose availability has temporal correlation. We applied our methodology on real traces from the SETI@home project with more than 230,0 0 0 hosts. We showed that Markovian arrival process and ARIMA time series can model the availability and unavailability intervals of volunteer resources with a reasonable to excellent level of accuracy.

Understanding Collaboration in Volunteer Computing Systems	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Volunteer Computing; Collaboration Strategy; Software Design; Effort-Based Incentives; Resource Sharing		Volunteer computing is a paradigm in which devices participating in a distributed environment share part of their resources to help others perform their activities. The effectiveness of this computing paradigm depends on the collaboration attitude adopted by the participating devices. Unfortunately for software designers it is not clear how to contribute with local resources to the shared environment without compromising resources that could then be required by the contributors. Therefore, many designers adopt a conservative position when defining the collaboration strategy to be embedded in volunteer computing applications. This position produces an underutilization of the devices' local resources and reduces the effectiveness of these solutions. This article presents a study that helps designers understand the impact of adopting a particular collaboration attitude to contribute with local resources to the distributed shared environment. The study considers five collaboration strategies, which are analyzed in computing environments with both, abundance and scarcity of resources. The obtained results indicate that collaboration strategies based on effort- based incentives work better than those using contribution- based incentives. These results also show that the use of effort- based incentives does not jeopardize the availability of local resources for the local needs.

In situ observations and photographs of a juvenile spotted driftfish Ariomma regulus (Stromateiformes; Ariommatidae) swimming alongside the planktonic nudibranch Phylliroe lichtensteinii (Gastropoda; Phylliroidae) were made during blackwater scuba dives off Palm Beach, Florida, United States of America. In this paper, we describe this behavior, highlighting a previously undocumented zooplanktonic host used by fishes. This finding also demonstrates the importance of community science in advancing our understanding of the early life history of marine species.	[Pastana, Murilo N.

Participatory sensing initiatives organize individuals to gather sensed information using mobile devices through cooperative data collection. A major factor in the success of these data collection projects is sustained, high quality participation. However, since data capture requires a time and energy commitment from individuals, incentives are often introduced to motivate participants. In this work, we investigate the use of micro-payments as an incentive model. We define a set of metrics that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of incentives and report on findings from a pilot study using various micro-payment schemes in a university campus sustainability initiative.

In social media engagement by people participating as citizen scientists, expressions of emotions were a key feature. To further understand the implications of emotions for the science and for the citizens, we undertook interviews with a sub-set of recruited participants. These are contextualized by a discussion of key literature on citizen science and human-insect relations. The findings presented show how excitement, worry and joy were expressed by participants at different stages of the citizen science project. We then theorize on the role of emotion in this specific citizen science project and argue that emotion should be considered at the design stage of other citizen science projects as it can play a key role in creating experiences that are rewarding for citizens, as well as producing useful data for scientists.

Improving big citizen science data: Moving beyond haphazard sampling	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							DETECTION PROBABILITY; BIODIVERSITY; BIAS; MODELS; CONSERVATION; STATISTICS; PREDICT; TRENDS; FUTURE; STATE	Citizen science is mainstream: millions of people contribute data to a growing array of citizen science projects annually, forming massive datasets that will drive research for years to come. Many citizen science projects implement a leaderboard framework, ranking the contributions based on number of records or species, encouraging further participation. But is every data point equally valuable? Citizen scientists collect data with distinct spatial and temporal biases, leading to unfortunate gaps and redundancies, which create statistical and informational problems for downstream analyses. Up to this point, the haphazard structure of the data has been seen as an unfortunate but unchangeable aspect of citizen science data. However, we argue here that this issue can actually be addressed: we provide a very simple, tractable framework that could be adapted by broadscale citizen science projects to allow citizen scientists to optimize the marginal value of their efforts, increasing the overall collective knowledge.

Most biodiversity monitoring data are collected by volunteers through citizen science projects, and often crucial information is lacking to account for the inevitable biases that observers introduce during data collection. We contend that citizen science projects intended to support biodiversity monitoring must gather information about the observation process as well as species occurrence. We illustrate this using eBird, a global citizen science project that collects information on bird occurrences as well as vital contextual information on the observation process while maintaining broad participation. Our fundamental argument is that regardless of what species are being monitored, when citizen science projects collect a small set of basic information about how participants make their observations, the scientific value of the data collected will be dramatically improved.

How do marine and coastal citizen science experiences foster environmental engagement?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Behavior change; Community-based monitoring; Community engagement; Environmental identity; Procedural knowledge; Transformative learning	TRANSFORMATIVE LEARNING-THEORY; EDUCATION; SUSTAINABILITY; PARTICIPATION; MECHANISMS; LITERACY; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT	Citizen science programs enable community involvement in scientific research. In addition to fostering greater science literacy, some citizen science programs aim to foster engagement in environmental issues. However, few data are available to indicate whether and how citizen science programs can achieve greater environmental engagement. We survey individuals choosing to attend one of seventeen reef citizen science events and examine the extent to which attendees reported three indicators of greater environmental engagement: (i) willingness to share information, (ii) increased support for marine conservation and citizen science, and (iii) intentions to adopt a new behavior. Most participants reported being willing to share information about reef conservation (91%) and described increased support for marine science and conservation (87%). Half of participants (SA) reported intentions to adopt a new conservation behavior. We found that key elements of the citizen science experience associated with these outcomes were learning about actions to protect reefs and coasts (procedural learning), experiencing surprise, and experiencing negative emotions about environmental problems. Excitement was also associated with positive outcomes, but only in participants who were less likely to see themselves as environmental, or were less frequent visitors to reefs and coasts. Importantly, the association between factual learning and environmental engagement outcomes was limited or negative. These findings suggest that the way citizen science experiences make people feel, may be more important for fostering future environmental engagement than factual-based learning. When designing citizen science programs for community members, these findings provide a reminder to not focus on provision of factual information alone, but to highlight environmental impacts while providing meaningful experiences and building environmental skills.

Citizen science in hydrological monitoring and ecosystem services management: State of the art and future prospects	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Citizen engagement; Hydrology; Data; Water quality; Participation	LAND-USE CONFLICTS; WATER-QUALITY; SOCIAL MEDIA; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; CROWDSOURCED DATA; WEATHER STATIONS; RURAL WATERSHEDS; RIVER-BASIN; COMMUNITY; VOLUNTEER	Hydrological monitoring is essential to guide evidence-based decision making necessary for sustainable water resource management and governance. Limited hydrometric datasets and the pressure on long-term hydrological monitoring networks make it paramount to explore alternative methods for data collection. This is particularly the case for low-income countries, where data scarcity is more pronounced, and where conventional monitoring methods are expensive and logistically challenging. Citizen science in hydrological research has recently gained popularity and crowdsourced monitoring is a promising cost-effective approach for data collection. Citizen science also has the potential to enhance knowledge co-creation and science-based evidence that underpins the governance and management of water resources. This paper provides a comprehensive review on citizen science and crowdsourced data collection within the context of hydrology, based on a synthesis of 71 articles from 2001 to 2018. Application of citizen science in hydrology is increasing in number and breadth, generating a plethora of scientific data. Citizen science approaches differ in scale, scope and degree of citizen involvement. Most of the programs are found in North America and Europe. Participation mostly comprises a contributory citizen science model, which engages citizens in data collection. In order to leverage the full potential of citizen science in knowledge co-generation, future citizen science projects in hydrology could benefit from more co-created types of projects that establish strong ties between research and public engagement, thereby enhancing the long-term sustainability of monitoring networks.

However, GPS positioning is very energy consuming, which could drain a mobile device's battery quickly. High energy consumption may threaten the participants and reduce the sustainability of the participatory sensing systems. In this paper, we propose a collaborative localization strategy with load balancing. Simulations with real traces showed that our proposed solution can save more than 80% of the energy consumption for localization in the entire network with load balancing.

One, it must integrate stakeholder perspectives at multiple steps of the research process, and two, it must effectively communicate its knowledge and insights. Citizen science can be described as the involvement of the public in the scientific process, through a range of different approaches. We ask what such approaches can bring the landscape research and its stakeholders closer together. We survey the field of citizen science and present a number of typologies of approaches. Next, we introduce three applications of citizen science in the landscape context and examine them under the lens of the typologies. We find that each case employs citizen science to include stakeholders in different ways, but each of them limited to just one stage of the research process. Finally, we suggest ways forward for landscape research to achieve an integrative relationship between researchers and stakeholders.

We present a case study on the Helsinki Urban Rat Project in which students surveyed rat occurrence in their own near environments. According to our results, experientiality, involvement, meaningfulness, freedom to choose, ease of participation, and the rats themselves contributed to students' increased interest in participation. Furthermore, students described diverse factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge that they acquired during their participation. In general, students described negative attitudes toward rats, but they less negative views on rats after participation. We reflect on the success of the citizen science project and implications of planning a future citizen science project and incorporating citizen science in formal education.

Beyond water data: benefits to volunteers and to local water from a citizen science program	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						behavior change; citizen science; social networks; volunteer motivation; watershed planning	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; TOOL; PARTICIPATION; MOTIVATIONS; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; QUALITY; BIODIVERSITY; SCIENTISTS; ATTITUDES	Survey results of citizen science water data collection volunteers are presented, indicating personal benefits (e.g., being in nature, helping local water quality), and suggesting potential long-term benefits of improved watershed health (e.g., behavior change). These results can inform citizen science program development and contribute to watershed planners' understanding of the broad benefits of such programs. We suggest that respondents' positive feelings toward the watershed's major river and desire to learn about science and nature are place-specific elements that watershed and citizen science program managers could utilize in program development. Moreover, we explore the potential of social diffusion and behavior change and suggest the need for further research in these areas. We conclude that citizen science has potential not just as a means to collect large amounts of data (cheaply), but as a means to engage citizens to make environmentally friendly decisions.

The questionnaire was answered by 1,002 residents of 48 Spanish cities. The study population was 50% female and spanned various age groups, occupations, and levels of education. The results indicate that although the population has a quite favorable opinion of citizen science, people feel underinformed about it. Very few respondents consider it to be negative and many expect it to have a positive impact over the coming decade. While both men and women exhibit intrinsic motivations to participate in citizen science, women specifically exhibit social motives for contributing. The data reveal differences in respondents' attitude to citizen science depending on gender, age, level of education, and occupation. The data suggest that incorporating a balanced and representative sample of the public into scientific endeavor will require greater institutional intervention in coming years.

Citizen science can be an effective tool for IAS surveillance, management, and research, providing large datasets over wide spatial extents and long time periods, with public participants generating knowledge that supports action. We demonstrate how citizen science has contributed knowledge across the biological invasion process, especially for early detection and distribution mapping. However, we recommend that citizen science could be used more for assessing impacts and evaluating the success of IAS management. Citizen science does have limitations, and we explore solutions to two key challenges: ensuring data accuracy and dealing with uneven spatial coverage of potential recorders (which limits the dataset's "fit for purpose"). Greater co-development of citizen science with public stakeholders will help us better realize its potential across the biological invasion process and across ecosystems globally while meeting the needs of participants, local communities, scientists, and decision-makers.

The particular interest in this chapter lies with the citizens and their motivations to participate in ICT-enabled citizen science since, arguably, without citizen participation, there is no citizen science activity. The authors examine in detail what determines citizens' interest to share their weather-related data collected with Personal Weather Stations via online amateur networks and how these citizen activities could be up-scaled to address prevalent hydro-meteorological data gaps. A decision making theory is used to guide empirical research in three European countries. The results indicate no regional differences between the main drivers and incentives and raise the question whether weather observation is still a male-dominated activity in the digital age which would have implications for upscaling this citizen science initiative.

It is shown that for the class of estimators, if the strategic sensors have access to noiseless measurements of the to-be-estimated-variable, truth-telling is an equilibrium of the game that models the interplay between the sensors and the estimator. Furthermore, performance of the proposed estimators is examined in the case that the strategic sensors form coalitions and in the presence of noise.

A review of key success factors and motivational aspects	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Review							SCIENCE; PARTICIPATION; BARRIERS	Citizen science and particularly mobile crowd sourcing (MCS) has large potential in water resources management for data collection and awareness raising. Concerns about data quality, and initiating and sustaining citizen involvement hamper incorporation of citizen science in water monitoring, together with a lack of practical guidance how to set up citizen science monitoring programs. This review presents an overview of key success factors for citizen science including MCS. Specific attention is paid to motivational aspects. Success factors were organized according to project phase and motivations according to selfdetermination theory. The presented overviews provide practical guidelines for setting up citizen science projects. (C) 2017 The Authors. WIREs Water published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Receiving contributions from multiple individuals may result however, in corrupted and inaccurate sensed data. Therefore, it becomes important to be able to have enough knowledge about each participant in order to evaluate their contributions and trustworthiness. In this paper, we present a Reputation System to Evaluate Participants (RSEP). The RSEP, starts with grouping participants based on their contributions, and then selects the highest group value based on its participant reputation values. The RSEP filters the sensed data to separate out the most accurate contributions that enhance the purpose of the participatory sensing applications. Experimental results show that the proposed RSEP has a high accuracy level in evaluating and selecting participant contributions.

To support the development of a watershed management plan and foster public appreciation of the value of the riparian zone, Mohonk Preserve established a volunteer monitoring program surveying sites for invasive species. Between 2017 and 2019, citizen scientists repeatedly surveyed 20 sites in the Hudson River Valley in New York for 10 invasive plant species: purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.), common reed [Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud], multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora Thunb.), garlic mustard [Alliaria petiolata (M. Bieb.) Cavara & Grande], dame's rocket (Hesperis matronalis L.), Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum Siebold & Zucc.), wineberry (Rubus phoenicolasius Maxim.), barberry (Berberis spp.), Japanese stiltgrass [Microstegium vimineum (Trin.) A. Camus], and Asiatic bittersweet (oriental bittersweet, Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb.). We found that the number of target species detected was higher on sites closer to paved roads and with increasing drainage area size, while lower with higher percentages of forested land in the basin. Our analysis results highlight variation in the presence of target invasive species across the Hudson River Valley region, highlighting sites and areas to monitor for future introductions and take action to prevent species' invasions. Our results highlight differences in the most relevant abiotic factors for hydrophytes and non-hydrophyte species, underscoring the importance of considering species' life-history traits before the development of management plans for invasive plant species in the riparian zone. Our case study of community-collected data in the Hudson River Valley region using a relatively simple monitoring protocol can provide a road map for other regions fostering volunteer engagement with invasive plants.

A Probabilistic Approach for Filtering out Spam Reports in a Vehicular Participatory Sensing System	2016 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS (COMSNETS)	International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	JAN 05-10, 2016	Bangalore, INDIA			Participatory sensing; Probabilistic approach; Confidence estimation; False report filtering		Participatory sensing (PS) is an emerging socio-technological paradigm by which citizens voluntarily participate and contribute to a distributed information management system using applications installed in their hand-held devices. However, a common problem in participatory sensing is that some users generate spam (false) reports to increase their degree of participation to maliciously gain undue incentives. Such spam reports make the usage of the PS system unreliable and vulnerable to illusion attacks. This work proposes a novel approach to make PS applications authentic by identifying and filtering out spam reports through automated confidence assignment based on a probabilistic model. Waze traffic alerts have been used to validate the proposed report filtering mechanism. Results have been found to be satisfactory and useful in enhancing reliability of the PS system.

The purpose of the chapter is to examine the role of informal learning setting activities, namely citizen science programs, in promoting student metacognition and STEM career motivation from a social cognitive career perspective. Citizen science programs involve data collection on the part of hobbyists to contribute to the work of professional scientists on large scale natural studies. In order to assemble data that is scientifically rigorous, hobbyists receive training on data collection. According to research studies, the interaction with field experts in developing scientific observation skills has far reaching benefits in terms of student development of metacognitive skills, motivation, achievement, and STEM career pathways. In this chapter, we describe citizen science programs as a type of informal science learning approach that offers significant contributions in enhancing student metacognition and STEM career paths. We also provide information on essential characteristics of effective citizen science programs. Third, we focus on metacognition and its role on student achievement in science from a social cognitive perspective. Specifically, we address the development of scientific observation skills as a metacognitive process of student self-regulation, an integral component of citizen science programs. Fourth, we review research on the impact of citizen science programs on metacognition, motivational processes, and career planning. Fifth, we describe the design of effective citizen science programs within an educational context. Finally, we will discuss implications for educators, students, parents, and policymakers as citizen science programs are pertinent pedagogical activities which reinforce student metacognition, science achievement, and STEM career motivation. Future directions and recommendations of research are also discussed.

Hybrid wireless aided volunteer computing paradigm	WIRELESS NETWORKS			English	Article						Crowd-sourcing; Data processing; Wireless computing; Volunteer computing	BIG DATA; PERFORMANCE; ALLOCATION	Big-data acquisition and processing is important in developing value driven machine learning applications. This is challenging in compute resource-constrained scenarios. Compute resource-constrained scenarios arise due to low capacity of installed cloud infrastructure and low availability of high speed internet links. These factors limit the ability to process crowd-sourced data to develop machine learning applications. The volunteer computing paradigm is found to be suitable for addressing these challenges. Volunteer computing paradigm makes use of computing nodes provided by users distributed over a geographical area. It leverages on the availability of volunteers with low cost computing entities. This paper proposes the fractionated computing system (FCS) to address the challenges described above. FCS incorporates intelligent compute node selection and uses high performance end-user computing nodes (laptops) to process the crowd-sourced data. The performance of FCS is investigated against the existing method of using cloud servers. Results show that FCS reduces acquisition costs and power consumption by 35% and up to 56.5% on average, respectively. The watt per bit expended in processing crowd-sourced data is also enhanced by up to 98% on average. In addition, the use of FCS enhances memory resources accessible for data processing. Simulations show that increasing memory in modular computing entities by up to 58.7% enhances memory available across network of modular volunteer computing nodes by 0.5 EB. The use of end-user nodes with modular communication subsystems instead of end-user computing nodes with non-modular communication sub-systems enhances channel capacity by 37.5% on average.

Citizen science is valuable in supporting the early detection of tree pests and diseases. Different stakeholders (government, business, society and individual) will vary in their opinion of the balance between costs and benefits of early detection and consequent management, partly because many costs are local whereas benefits are felt at larger scales. This can create clashes in motivations of those involved in citizen science, thus leading to ethical dilemmas about what is good and responsible conduct for the use of citizen science. We draw on our experience of tree health citizen science to exemplify five dilemmas. These dilemmas arise because: the consequences of detection may locally be severe (e.g. the destruction of trees); knowledge of these impacts could lead to refusal to make citizen science reports; citizen science reports can be made freely, but can be costly to respond to; participants may expect solutions even if these are not possible; and early detection is (by definition) a rare event. Effective engagement and dialogue across stakeholders, including public stakeholders, is important to properly address these issues. This is vital to ensure the public's long-term support for and trust in the use of citizen science for the early detection of tree pests and diseases.	[Pocock, Michael J.

In particular, it opens up scientific research processes by involving citizens at different phases; this also creates a range of opportunities for science communication to happen This article explores methodological and practical characteristics of citizen science as a form of science communication by examining three case studies that took different approaches to citizens' participation in science. Through these, it becomes clear that communication in citizen science is always science communication and an essential part of "doing science".

The bidirectional benefits it generates, especially in the field of health, including empowerment, new hypotheses, and results, and addressing issues truly important to society, justify the necessity to establish a common framework and address barriers to ensure a fruitful evolution of this new approach within nursing research. The aim was to analyze nursing projects with a citizen science focus that have been conducted. Methods: PRISMA guidelines were employed to conduct a systematic review. Searches were conducted on PubMed, CINHAL, LILACS, IBECS, and Cochrane. Following the identification and screening process, 13 studies were included. The quality of the articles was assessed using the Joanna Brigg Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist and the quality of citizen science research using the Citizen Science Appraisal Tool. Results: Citizen science studies in nursing were notably recent (2017-2023). Five research areas were identified, with environmental health being the most predominant. Multiple tools, both technological and traditional, were utilized, with the "Photovoice" and "Our Voice" methodologies being prominent. Citizen participation was limited to data collection and analysis in 7 out of the 13 studies, with most studies working with small samples. Findings regarding the application of this practice were positive, but no study exceeded 26 points on the CSAT scale to be considered high quality in citizen science. Conclusions: Citizen science can be a promising approach within the field of nursing. There is a need to increase individual participation to fully realize the potential bidirectional benefits. It is imperative to establish a common theoretical framework and continue working on the development of this methodology within nursing.

Citizen science has been widely applied in research, particularly in the social sciences, environmental sciences, information and communication technologies, and public health. However, the application of this approach in clinical sciences, particularly in translational medicine research, is still nascent. This exploratory study involved members of the public (citizen scientists) in a translational medicine experiment on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that incorporated a lifestyle and weight-loss intervention. The aim of this paper is to report successful methods and approaches for the recruitment, retention, and training of citizen scientists. For the citizen scientists' recruitment, online calls placed on the websites of our research project and biomedical research center and targeted emails were the most helpful. Of the 14 members of the public who expressed interest in our study, six were recruited as citizen scientists. Citizen scientists were mostly female (n = 5, 83%), white (n = 3, 50%), over 50 years of age (n = 4, 67%), educated to postgraduate level (n = 5, 83%), and either retired or not in employment (n = 5, 83%). The retention rate was 83% (n = 5), and the dropout rate was 17% (n = 1). We arranged instructor-led interactive online training sessions (an hour-long one-on-one session and two-hour group sessions). Research skills training covered ethics in research and qualitative and quantitative data analysis. Citizen scientists were given several incentives, such as reimbursement of travel and care costs, selection as citizen scientists of the month, publications of their blogs and perspective articles, and coauthorship and acknowledgement in papers and project deliverables. To conclude, members of the public (particularly middle-aged white women with postgraduate education) are interested in becoming citizen scientists in translational medicine research. Their retention rate is higher, and they can contribute to different research activities. However, they need training to develop their research skills and expertise. The training should be simple, comprehensive, and flexible to accommodate the schedules of individual citizen scientists. They deserve incentives as they work on a voluntary basis.

One of the challenges presented by citizen science is the training of volunteers in the tasks required by the research project. A valid approach is through gamification strategies. Gamification is the use of game elements in contexts that were not intended to he a game. In this article, we present a study of the use of gamification in tutorials for a citizen science project of astronomy photo classification. The evaluations showed that the aesthetics, the evaluation by points, the promotion with badges and the competition have been promising elements in this type of tutorials.

Using representative technologies and other examples, we examine the future of citizen science in terms of its research processes, program and participant cultures, and scientific communities. Future citizen-science projects will likely be influenced by sociocultural issues related to new technologies and will continue to face practical programmatic challenges. We foresee networked, open science and the use of online computer/video gaming as important tools to engage non-traditional audiences, and offer recommendations to help prepare project managers for impending challenges. A more formalized citizen-science enterprise, complete with networked organizations, associations, journals, and cyberinfrastructure, will advance scientific research, including ecology, and further public education.

On the impact of Citizen Science-derived data quality on deep learning based classification in marine images	PLOS ONE			English	Article								The evaluation of large amounts of digital image data is of growing importance for biology, including for the exploration and monitoring of marine habitats. However, only a tiny percentage of the image data collected is evaluated by marine biologists who manually interpret and annotate the image contents, which can be slow and laborious. In order to overcome the bottleneck in image annotation, two strategies are increasingly proposed: "citizen science" and "machine learning". In this study, we investigated how the combination of citizen science, to detect objects, and machine learning, to classify megafauna, could be used to automate annotation of underwater images. For this purpose, multiple large data sets of citizen science annotations with different degrees of common errors and inaccuracies observed in citizen science data were simulated by modifying "gold standard" annotations done by an experienced marine biologist. The parameters of the simulation were determined on the basis of two citizen science experiments. It allowed us to analyze the relationship between the outcome of a citizen science study and the quality of the classifications of a deep learning megafauna classifier. The results show great potential for combining citizen science with machine learning, provided that the participants are informed precisely about the annotation protocol. Inaccuracies in the position of the annotation had the most substantial influence on the classification accuracy, whereas the size of the marking and false positive detections had a smaller influence.

One area affected by this transformation is citizen science, where geospatial technologies facilitated its more widespread use and revolutionized the way scientific knowledge is coproduced, especially in the environmental context. Geographic citizen science is widely used to support the collection and analysis of geolocated scientific data, extend existing geographic data coverage, and enable communities to address local issues. The inherent complexity of geospatial interfaces and data is widely recognized and there is a wealth of geographic research focusing on improving human-map interactions, with less emphasis, nevertheless, given to citizen science. Not only do these applications have their unique characteristics, but inclusiveness is paramount, which further adds to these complexities. Through an investigation of 229 geographic citizen science applications, we provide an overview of how geographic interfaces are currently employed in citizen science. We then evaluate a selection of applications to identify critical usability barriers, which might have a detrimental impact on the overall user experience and the success of these projects. Among others, we found that geographic citizen science applications need to better support visual thinking and leverage participants' geographic knowledge. We subsequently provide a set of recommendations for map design and functionality and identify opportunities for future geovisualization research.

Contributions to conservation outcomes by natural history museum-led citizen science: Examining evidence and next steps	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						citizen science; natural history museums; biodiversity; digitization; conservation education; natural resource management	COLLECTIONS; BIODIVERSITY; PARTICIPATION; MANAGEMENT; PROGRAM	Through their unique combination of specimen collections, scientific and public education expertise, and wide audience reach and trust, natural history museums (NHMs) are obvious settings for bridging conservation science and education through citizen science. Building on over 100 years of amateur naturalist contributions to bio-diversity science, a wide range of NHM-based citizen science programs have emerged recently. Yet no comparative studies of the conservation outcomes of this work exist. Here we ask; what is the evidence that NHM citizen science contributes to conservation, what kinds of programs and strategies do so, and how could this approach be better realized for conservation goals? We analyzed 44 citizen science programs across three museums (one U.K., two U.S.) to assess whether and how they contribute to conservation-relevant outcomes. We found evidence that they support conservation both directly, through site and species management, and indirectly through research, education and policy impacts. This study has implications for understanding the role NHMs can play in maximizing the socio-ecological impacts of citizen science, including bringing citizen science to new audiences, mobilizing volunteers to collect and analyze data to study species invasions and impacts of global changes, and conducting locally-relevant research in urban systems. NHM citizen science can provide multiple entry-points and levels of engagement for participants in science and access to new means of studying bio-diversity, both in the field and virtually. From our findings we recommend collaboration among the research and education staff within NHMs and other similar conservation organizations, as well as partnerships with external organizations to successfully contribute to conservation outcomes.

Citizen observatories (COs) are especially interesting because public authorities are often involved in the setup and the participation barrier for citizens is reduced by relying on smartphones. Citizen science and COs both foster public participation in scientific research. An evaluation framework can increase the quality of and the trust in citizen science data. Although considered important by existing evaluation frameworks for citizen science, detailed instructions on how to evaluate data accuracy are lacking. This is especially the case in domains where citizen science has not been widely used, such as mobility. This paper therefore presents a framework to evaluate the data quality of a CO for mobility. The framework includes representativeness, accuracy, reliability, and validity. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to a CO in Ghent, Belgium, in which cyclists used their smartphones to collect their perceived and objective waiting times at signalised intersections. Although the representativeness of the data could be improved, the data was found to be accurate. Data showed that participants on average spent 4% of their trip time waiting at signalised intersections. Furthermore, no clear overestimation or underestimation of the waiting time was found. The main limitation of the evaluation framework is the focus on data quality, which is only one aspect of citizen science.

This requires a deep understanding and inclusion of diverse stakeholders. In marine environments, divers are among the largest groups of citizen science volunteers, compared to other marine users. However, little is known about how the diversity of divers can affect their interest and participation in citizen science. Using 229 structured face-to-face interviews we investigated differences in diving specialization levels among diver types (i.e. artisanal fishers, dive instructors, recreational divers, divers with scientific background, and others) and we evaluated the relationship between diving specialization level and actual participation in Marine Citizen Science. Findings show important differences in diving specialization levels among diver types. Recreational divers have the lowest levels of specialization and artisanal fishers the highest. High levels of scientific training favored participation in the citizen science project, but there was no relationship between diving specialization level and participation rate. We conclude that different diver types have particular strengths and requirements to participate in Marine Citizen Science, and that integrating a diversity of divers can create important synergies. Taking the heterogeneity of potential participants into account will help engage a greater diversity of volunteers in citizen science and thus contribute to generating better policies and stakeholder support for marine conservation and sustainable management.

This article systematically reviewed literature that jointly addressed climate change and nature-based citizen science and identified 23 reported learning outcomes. Overall, evidence related to learning outcomes was limited across reviewed studies, but documentation of outcomes that are directly relevant to collective climate action was particularly scarce. Findings suggest more research examining citizen science from a collective climate action perspective is needed. To support future research efforts, results link the 23 revealed learning outcomes to two potential evaluation frameworks.

The catchment remains ungauged despite providing diverse ecosystem services. Study focus: Studies typically assume that calibrated model parameters remain valid outside the calibration period despite many catchments undergoing anthropogenic change. We evaluated the value of citizen science data to improve a rainfall-runoff model performance in the urbanizing Akaki catchment. Five and nineteen people trained as citizen scientists monitored river stage and rainfall data, respectively, for three years. Rating curves were developed for the conversion of stage data into river flow data. A HEC-HMS model, calibrated for a historical period, was evaluated using citizen science data. Next, we assessed the effectiveness of progressively updating model parameters using a recent land use land cover map and citizen science data. Then, the HEC-HMS model was recalibrated at the catchment outlet and validated at multiple sub-catchments' outlets. Finally, the model was recalibrated at multiple sub-catchments' outlets using citizen science data. New hydrological insights for the region: the HEC-HMS model of the Akaki, which was calibrated for a historical period, does not capture the current rainfall-runoff response. However, the model simulations were made useful by revisiting the model calibration at multiple sub-catchments' outlets using citizen science data. Overall, this article demonstrates the value of citizen science data for model calibration and validation.

Characterizing the Breadth and Depth of Volunteer Water Monitoring Programs in the United States	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Citizen science; Public participation in scientific research; Volunteer monitoring; Watershed management	NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT; CITIZEN SCIENCE; PARTICIPATION; WATCH	A survey of 345 volunteer water monitoring programs in the United States was conducted to document their characteristics, and perceived level of support for data to inform natural resource management or policy decisions. The response rate of 86% provided information from 46 states. Programs represented a range of ages, budgets, objectives, scopes, and level of quality assurance, which influenced data uses and perceived support by sponsoring agency administrators and external decision makers. Most programs focused on rivers, streams, and lakes. Programs had not made substantial progress to develop EPA or state-approved quality assurance plans since 1998, with only 48% reporting such plans. Program coordinators reported feeling slightly more support for data to be used for management as compared to policy decisions. Programs with smaller budgets may be at particular risk of being perceived to lack credibility due to failure to develop quality assurance plans. Over half of programs identified as collaborative, in that volunteers assisted scientists in program design, data analysis and/or dissemination of results. Just under a third were contributory, in which volunteers primarily collected data in a scientist-defined program. Recommendations to improve perceived data credibility, and to augment limited budgets include developing quality assurance plans and gaining agency approval, and developing partnerships with other organizations conducting monitoring in the area to share resources and knowledge. Funding agencies should support development of quality assurance plans to help ensure data credibility. Service providers can aid in plan development by providing training to program staff over time to address high staff turnover rates.

In this paper, we demonstrate that with the use of virtual machine technology, at least some standard LHC computing tasks can be tackled with volunteer computing resources. Specifically, by presenting volunteer computing resources to HEP scientists as a "volunteer cloud", essentially identical to a Grid or dedicated cluster from a job submission perspective, LHC simulations can be processed effectively. This article outlines both the technical steps required for such a solution and the implications for LHC computing as well as for LHC public outreach and for participation by scientists from developing regions in LHC research.

Timely and accurate information about the occurrence of non-indigenous species are of major importance for the mitigation of the issue. However, still large gaps in knowledge about marine bioinvasion exist. Mediterranean Sea is among the most impacted ecoregions globally. In this work we present a comprehensive overview of the project "Is is Alien to you? Share it!!!" which monitors non-indigenous species in Greece and Cyprus with the help of citizen scientists. The goal of this work is to present this project as a case study in order to demonstrate how citizen science can substantially contribute to the monitoring of biological invasions. We compared the projects database with the databased of ELNAIS and EASIN, for discuss weaknesses and advantages and future steps for advancing the effort. In total 691 records of marine alien and cryptogenic species were collected in these 2 years from Greece and Cyprus, with the density of records reaching 20 observations per km(2) in some locations. The project has contributed significantly in the assessment of descriptor D2 "Exotic Species" of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, with 3 new species for Greece. Future steps should focus on training citizens to report less reported taxa and raising the awareness of all relevant stakeholders.

Alongside their individual benefits, when combined, they offer considerable synergies that can aid in both better monitoring of, and achieving, sustainable development. While AI has already been integrated into citizen science projects such as through automated classification and identification, the integration of citizen science approaches into AI is lacking. This integration has, however, the potential to address some of the major challenges associated with AI such as social bias, which could accelerate progress towards achieving sustainable development.

By utilizing Java's object-oriented features, we have built a flexible software framework that makes it easy for programmers to write different volunteer computing applications, while allowing researchers to study and develop the underlying mechanisms behind them. In this paper, we show how we have used this framework to write master-worker style applications, and to develop approaches to the problems of programming interface, adaptive parallelism, fault-tolerance, computational security, scalability, and user interface design.

Citizen Science Mosquito Surveillance by Ad Hoc Observation Using the iNaturalist Platform	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						citizen science; mosquito; mobile application; public health	DISEASE; MOTIVATIONS; VOLUNTEERS; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; AUSTRALIA; CULICIDAE; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; NETWORK	Citizen science mosquito surveillance has been growing in recent years due to both increasing concern about mosquito-borne disease and the increasing popularity of citizen science projects globally. Health authorities are recognising the potential importance of citizen science to expanding or enhancing traditional surveillance programs. Different programs have shown success in engaging communities to monitor species of medical importance through low-cost methods. The Mozzie Monitors project was established on iNaturalist-an open citizen science platform that allows participants to upload photos (i.e., observers) and assist identification (i.e., identifiers). This article describes the likelihood of citizen scientists submitting photos of mosquitoes, assesses user submission behaviour, and evaluates public health utility from these citizen science-derived data. From October 2018 to July 2021, the Mozzie Monitors project on iNaturalist received 2118 observations of 57 different species of mosquitoes across Australia. The number of observers in the system increased over time with more than 500 observers and 180 identifiers being active in the project since its establishment. Data showed species bias with large-bodied and colourful mosquitoes being over-represented.

J	Bopardikar, A; Bernstein, D; McKenney, S				Bopardikar, Anushree; Bernstein, Debra; McKenney, Susan			Designer considerations and processes in developing school-based citizen-science curricula for environmental education	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						curriculum design; citizen-science; participant-observation; case study	CONTEXT; STANDARDS; STUDENTS; PROJECT; CHALLENGES	School-based citizen-science can be a powerful means to engage youth in environmental education, yet developing robust science curricula around citizen-science activities is tremendously challenging. Prior research provides limited examples and very little guidance for curriculum designers. To support the designers of school-based citizen-science curricula, this research article presents a participant-observation case study of designer thinking and processes in creating and integrating in-class curriculum with citizen-science fieldwork. Interviews, observations, and documents of designer work aimed at supporting middle school students' learning of climate change were analysed to gain insight into designer thinking, challenges, and resolutions. Findings indicate how designer work evolved through various measures, including appraisal by external advisors, inspiring examples, surveys of teachers' implementations, and written pre-post assessments of student learning throughout the phases of analysis, development, and evaluation of the curriculum. Four key considerations for designing school-based citizen-science curricula emerged from the data: creating the learning environment around the fieldwork; tackling concerns about data quality and utility; making scientist-designed fieldwork engaging to students; and balancing scientific and educational goals. These considerations are discussed in light of relevant literature, and educational implications for design and research are presented.

Citizen science has been suggested as a cost-effective means by which this call can be met, and by which monitoring for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) may be carried out. Indeed, citizen science has gained significant attention in recent years as the scale of environmental issues surpasses the monitoring resources that currently exist. However, many challenges continue to act as a barrier to the acceptance of citizen science as a reliable scientific approach. Here, the current state of knowledge on the use of citizen science in water quality monitoring is reviewed, and the potential for utilizing this approach to enhance monitoring for SDG Indicator 6.3.2 on the "proportion of bodies of water of good ambient water quality" is evaluated. The objective of this review is to identify key knowledge gaps and hurdles hindering the adoption of citizen science contributions to water quality monitoring under the SDGs, so that these gaps may be addressed in a timely manner for future monitoring programmes.

In order to work efficiently, citizen science requires the adoption of proper technological solutions by a critical mass of people. According to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, people are more likely to adopt a technology that is compatible with their norms, values, and beliefs. In our research, we studied technological solutions that Polish environmental civic initiatives are using in order to diagnose their potential to implement citizen science projects and increase citizen participation. We interviewed 28 board representatives, managers, and initiators of social movements and conducted desk research of 65 social movements in Poland. Every technological solution was recorded and later categorized. The diagnostic analysis of the technological advancement of grassroots movements in Poland reveals that the full potential for launching citizen science projects has not yet been reached. First of all, the recognition of the citizen science approach is still low. Secondly, grassroots movements operate using standard and easily accessible technological solutions, rarely developing tailored and more advanced technologies that would enable people to be involved in citizen science projects.

MIND THE RELATIONSHIP: A MULTI- LAYERED ETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CITIZEN SCIENCE IN HEALTH	ETICA & POLITICA			English	Article						Capabilities approach; care ethics; citizen science; health; justice; participation; respect	KNOWLEDGE	There is a heated debate about what citizen science is and is not. We argue that instead of aiming at a definition of citizen science, we should reflect upon its ethical starting points. Based on our practical experiences with citizen science initiatives, we come up with an ethical framework that consists of two core values (respect and justice), five ethical desiderata (relationship between equals; recognition of each other's capacities, knowledge, and agency; reciprocity; openness for different goals; and openness for different research methods and paradigms) and two fundamental qualities (symmetry and transparency). The desiderata reflect ethically problematic practices, such as the use of citizens by academic scientists as mere sensors, and biases in the existing literature, such as labelling the projects that are initiated and led by citizens as "extreme". The desiderata are supported by two ethical theories: care ethics and the capabilities approach. The aim of our ethical framework is to stimulate and facilitate reflection upon what needs to be considered when co-creating or assessing a citizen science initiative. Fundamentally, citizen science ought to be a humanizing endeavour unlocking the investigative capacities of humans. The ethical framework is meant to help reflect on this endeavour.

This is needed to foster informed democratic involvement of critical, environmentally informed citizens. Can these aspirations be facilitated by school-based citizen science that offers opportunity to engage scientifically with environmental issues at a scale with local relevance? This is tested through application of Marine Metre Squared (Mm(2)), a citizen science initiative for long-term monitoring of the New Zealand intertidal zone. Through direct observation and "hands-on" engagement, participants are involved in place-based learning that connects them with nature. Strong interest from teachers and uptake into school programmes has been key to its success in collecting long term biodiversity data. Through facilitated delivery, the project also has the capacity to meet school curriculum goals and develop the environmental science citizenship capabilities of participants. Assessing the use of Mm(2) as a citizen science intervention within schools, we found that it affected science learning, skill development and environmental attitudes. Our findings further demonstrate the effect of extended involvement in a citizen science project, the value of a local issue-focused project for student learning outside the classroom, and how school science education can be enriched through citizen science to also grow civic responsibility for the environment (environmental citizenship).

As the field expands, it is becoming increasingly important to consider its potential to foster education and learning opportunities. Although progress has been made to support learning in citizen science projects, as well as to facilitate citizen science in formal and informal learning environments, challenges still arise. This paper identifies a number of dilemmas facing the field-from competing scientific goals and learning outcomes, differing underlying ontologies and epistemologies, diverging communication strategies, to clashing values around advocacy and activism. Although such challenges can become barriers to the successful integration of citizen science into mainstream education systems, they also serve as signposts for possible synergies and opportunities. One of the key emerging recommendations is to align educational learning outcomes with citizen science project goals at the planning stage of the project using co-creation approaches to ensure issues of accessibility and inclusivity are paramount throughout the design and implementation of every project.

However the effort and cost involved in participating in and launching such projects may explain why only a few high-profile projects use it and why only 0.1% of Internet users participate in them. We present Pando, a system designed to be easy to deploy and which does not require dedicated servers. It enables a thousand browser tabs to be used for computation. We have implemented a command-line version of Pando that makes it easy to launch volunteer computing projects on the Web as part of a Unix processing pipeline. Volunteers join by simply opening a Web page. We successfully tested the tool on the Grid5000 testbed and provide all scripts and procedures necessary to replicate our experiments.

Citizen science projects have been shown to enable large-scale data collection, increase scientific literacy, and monitor environmental quality. However, few studies have examined the individual-level motivations and impacts of citizen science participation. We employ an exploratory multi-method approach (on-line surveys, a focus-group session, informal interviews, and descriptive statements) to evaluate the experiences of citizen scientists volunteering with two conservation organizations based in Bangalore, India. Our findings suggest that citizen science may contribute to increased environmental awareness among the general public. In particular, we identify a three-step process whereby highly motivated individuals, or environmental opinion leaders, seek out citizen science opportunities due to an interest in one or more environmental issues; gain expertise through citizen science participation; and diffuse acquired skills and knowledge to peers through social networks, education of other non-scientist Indian citizens, and/or changes in career or education trajectories. As a result, citizen scientists in India promote environmental principles through an active environmental advocacy network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In a participatory sensing system, the platform recruits workers to participate in multiple sensing processes. However, sensing processes have limited budgets. A smartphone is only satisfied when it receives a reward large enough to cover its cost caused, e.g., by resource consumption. Considering the rationality of smartphone workers, it is of great importance for the participatory sensing system to satisfy as many workers as possible, in order to stimulate more smartphone participation. In this paper, we propose a general sensing processes participation game framework with heterogenous workers and heterogenous sensing processes. We show that it is NP hard to find a sensing processes participation solution which maximizes the number of satisfied workers. Inspired by the finite improvement property of the game, we design and implement an algorithm of sensing processes participation, which guarantees to reach a pure Nash equilibrium in polynomial time, and allows workers to change their strategy profiles asynchronously. Simulation results show that our algorithm is effective and efficient.

Mobile phone is closely related to participant's daily life, therefore the invasion of privacy in participatory sensing would have dire consequences. In this research, we study privacy-preserving participatory sensing technique which is the perturbation using negative surveys and limited negative surveys on mobile to promote use of participatory sensing in healthcare, investigation, and other useful applications. When participants report the data in negative surveys, their mobile phones automatically select a value from the set complement of the sensed data value at random. In other words, we can construct public statistics without knowing the personal information of citizens. Additionally, our research extends negative surveys to limited negative surveys, which have the capable of change, according to the feature of data, especially the number of categories. We combine negative survey and limited negative survey, because it is difficult to construct valuable databases when the categories of perturbed is large size on mobile phone. We also present the evaluation of these schemes on the view point of privacy and utility of data sets in central collection server.

In this paper, we propose a pseudonym-based privacy protection scheme, that takes both privacy protection and user incentives into consideration.

Predictive models, learned from data, offer a way to generalize from sparse observations, but the models themselves need to be statistically reliable to offer a reliable service. To achieve service reliability, this paper offers a modeling approach, where simpler models are used initially, gradually transitioning to more elaborate models, when enough data is collected. A key challenge and contribution of the work is to time model transitions correctly to provide theoretical guarantees on modeling error. Our technique takes a holistic approach in bounding modeling error as opposed to prior statistical approaches that bound the error of a single model component at a time. This technique is tested in the context of a vehicular participatory sensing application.

This paper proposes a generic participatory sensing framework that consists of a set of well-defined modules in support of diverse use cases. This framework incorporates a concept of "human-as-a-sensor" into participatory sensing and allows the public crowd to contribute human observations as well as sensor measurements from their mobile devices. We specifically address two issues: incentive and extensibility, where the former refers to motivating participants to contribute high-quality data while the latter refers to accommodating heterogeneous and uncertain data sources. To address the incentive issue, we design an incentive engine to attract high-quality contributed data independent of data modalities. This engine works together with a novel social network that we introduce into participatory sensing, where participants are linked together and interact with each other based on data quality and quantity they have contributed. To address the extensibility issue, the proposed framework embodies application-agnostic design and provides an interface to external datasets. To demonstrate and verify this framework, we have developed a prototype mobile application called imReporter, which crowdsources hybrid (image-text) reports from participants in an urban city, and incorporates an external dataset from a public data mall. A pilot study was also carried out with 15 participants for 3 consecutive weeks, and the result confirms that our proposed framework fulfills its design goals.

Alternatively, wireless sensor network offers a comprehensive platform for capturing the surrounding environmental information using mobile sensing nodes, e.g., the OpenSense project [2] in Switzerland deploying air quality sensors like CO on public transports like buses and trams. The two sensing platforms are typically isolated from each other. In this paper, we build ExposureSense, a rich mobile participatory sensing infrastructure that integrates the two independent sensing paradigms. ExposureSense is able to monitor people's daily activities as well to compute a reasonable estimation of pollution exposure in their daily life. Besides using external sensor networks, ExposureSense also supports pluggable sensors (e.g., O-3) to further enrich air quality data using mobile participatory sensing with smartphones.

Challenges for leveraging citizen science to support statistically robust monitoring programs	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Bias; Citizen science; Community science; Long-term monitoring; Sampling design; Population trend; Monarch butterfly; Danaus plexippus; Milkweed; Asclepias	MONARCH BUTTERFLIES; PROBABILITY SAMPLE; POPULATION; MODEL; EXTINCTION; ABUNDANCE	Large samples and long time series are often needed for effective broad-scale monitoring of status and trends in wild populations. Obtaining those sample sizes can be more feasible when volunteers contribute to the dataset, but volunteer-selected sites are not always representative of a population. Previous work to account for biased site selection has relied on knowledge of covariates to explain differences between site types, but such knowledge is often unavailable. For cases where relevant covariates have not been defined, we used a simulation study to identify the consequences of including non-probabilistically selected sites (NP sites) in addition to sites selected from a probability-based design (P sites), test modeling frameworks that might correct for biases, and evaluate whether those frameworks could allow NP sites to reduce the sampling requirement for P sites and potentially reduce costs of monitoring. We informed the simulation with pilot data from surveys of monarch butterflies and their obligate larval host plant, milkweed. We found strong biases in NP sites versus P sites in density and trends of monarchs and milkweed. Modeling frameworks that accounted for site type with a group effect or that strongly downweighted NP sites successfully produced unbiased estimates. However, sampling more NP sites typically did not improve accuracy or precision, and adding NP sites sometimes required also adding P sites to prevent biases. Further work on novel modeling frameworks would be useful to allow citizen-science data to contribute useful information to conservation.

J	Lee, JS; Hoh, B				Lee, Juong-Sik; Hoh, Baik			Dynamic pricing incentive for participatory sensing	PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Participatory sensing; Incentive mechanism; Reverse auction; Dynamic pricing		User participation is one of the most important elements in participatory sensing application for providing adequate level of service quality. However, incentive mechanism and its economic model for user participation have been less addressed so far in this research domain. This paper studies the economic model of user participation incentive in participatory sensing applications. To stimulate user participation, we design and evaluate a novel reverse auction based dynamic pricing incentive mechanism where users can sell their sensing data to a service provider with users' claimed bid prices. The proposed incentive mechanism focuses on minimizing and stabilizing the incentive cost while maintaining adequate level of participants by preventing users from dropping out of participatory sensing applications. Compared with random selection based fixed pricing incentive mechanism, the proposed mechanism not only reduces the incentive cost for retaining the same number of participants but also improves the fairness of incentive distribution and social welfare. It also helps us to achieve the geographically balanced sensing measurements and, more importantly, can remove the burden of accurate price decision for user data that is the most difficult step in designing incentive mechanism.

This article focuses on citizen-science conducted by voluntourists in an Australian conservation park, showing that such voluntourist-conducted conservation research is valued by participants, though challenges are identified, not least regarding the differing perceptions and expectations of the tours on offer. This is also potentially complicated by the often overlapping volunteer, tourist and researcher experiences, activities and identities. This study introduces a tentative typology of citizen-science activities that emerged during ethnographic fieldwork to help explore the voluntourists' engagement with citizen-science projects and their implications for broader citizenship awareness and behaviour.

Prompted from the inquiry by the Australian Government's Productivity Commission into the National Education Evidence Base and taking Early Childhood Education (ECE) as an example, this paper aims to provoke discussions about the possible contributions of a Citizen Science approach to broadening the methodological repertoire in ECE research and to positioning ECE research more powerfully in the politics of evidence. It argues that ECE stakeholders' involvement in building the evidence base through a Citizen Science approach could have the potential to make significant contributions to knowledge construction in ECE.

But how can citizen science be designed in an inclusive way? For this purpose, the paper describes a methodological framework in which citizens with disabilities as well as their representatives and stakeholders are involved in a concrete research and development process - following a high level on Arnstein's [1] ladder of participation. In this, people with disabilities not only take on a supplier function for scientists, but also co-determine research topics, instruments and outcomes. The paper describes a five-stage research process in which the "Wheelmap" - an online road map that shows wheelchair barriers - is jointly expanded by researchers from the project team and people from the target group. As a result, the Wheelmap is expanded through a citizen science approach and insights into the development of inclusive research methods are derived through the analysis of this process.

As the performance of these computers improves dramatically, updating the computing device is frequently. In Japan, solar photovoltaic is widely used, and the solar panels are installed to the roof of the general household. In the future, solar panels will become industrial waste. In the research stage, they are recycled at a high efficiency. Before the high efficiency of recycling is to progress to the commercial stage, there is a possibility that a large amount of solar panels are discarded.

In this paper, we present Drogon, a thermal sensing drone, which was used in an initial data gathering and co-design workshop with a group of conservation researchers, policy makers, and citizen scientist volunteers. Our findings reveal three concrete directions for future thermal drone-based citizen science projects. In addition, we reflect on higher-level design opportunities and challenges for working with drones in a citizen science context, including systems for expertise sharing amongst citizen scientists and platforms for collecting, analyzing and sharing drone-based data.

In these projects, citizens voluntarily contribute to the research aims set forward by the scientists through the collection and analysis of large datasets, without a preliminary technical background required. While advancements in information technology have facilitated the involvement of the general public in citizen science through online platforms, several projects still fail due to limited participation. This paper investigates the feasibility of using selected reward mechanisms to positively influence participation and motivations to contribute in a technology-mediated citizen science project. More specifically, we report the results of an empirical study on the effects of monetary and public online acknowledgement rewards. Survey indices and electroencephalographic measurements are synergistically integrated to offer a comprehensive basis for the analysis of citizens' motivations. Our results suggest that both reward mechanisms could crowd-in participants in technology-mediated citizen science projects. With this study, we seek to lay the foundations for a private collective research model, where the focus is the intensification of participation in technology-mediated citizen science projects.

J	Reinhardt, D; Heinig, C				Reinhardt, Delphine; Heinig, Christian			Survey-based exploration of attitudes to participatory sensing tasks in location-based gaming communities	PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Participatory sensing; Mobile sensing systems; Incentives	INCENTIVE MECHANISM; SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS; MOTIVATIONS	An increasing number of participatory sensing applications have been developed in recent years. However, most of them are still in the early adoption phase and count only few users as compared to the billions of devices that could be leveraged. On the other side, existing location-based games, such as geocaching or Ingress, gain in popularity and attract up to millions of users worldwide. Since the players of location-based games are already exploring their environment, one approach could be to especially address these communities in order to increase the user base of participatory sensing applications. To this end, we conduct a preliminary questionnaire-based study involving 337 participants to investigate the possible attitudes of such players towards participatory sensing applications. In particular, we analyze the potential interests of our participants in sensing tasks based on their demographics, played games, and sensing modalities. Our results show that our participants would prefer contributing to sensing tasks when integrated in geocaching. Moreover, a point-based reward system would not significantly motivate them and could even have negative consequences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Thornton, T; Leahy, J				Thornton, Teresa; Leahy, Jessica			TRUST IN CITIZEN SCIENCE RESEARCH: A CASE STUDY OF THE GROUNDWATER EDUCATION THROUGH WATER EVALUATION & TESTING PROGRAM	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						trust; citizen science; k-12 students; drinking water	SCIENTIFIC-KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT	Data collected by citizen scientists, including K-12 students, have been validated by the scientific community through quality assurance/quality control tests and publication of results in peer-reviewed journal articles. However, if citizen science data are to be used by local communities, research is needed to determine which factors contribute to local community member trust in citizen science data, and how to increase the benefits and use of citizen science programs. This article describes the Groundwater Education Through Water Evaluation & Testing (GET WET!) program that employs middle and high school students, state and local government employees, environmental nongovernmental organization leaders, business representatives, college faculty and students, and other volunteers as citizen scientists to create a database of groundwater quality for use as a baseline for local water resources management. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews pre- and post-involvement from 40 participants in this citizen science program conducted in five states in the northeastern United States. Results indicate that factors of trust are largely based on interpersonal trust and familiarity. We conclude with recommendations and future research that may improve local community member willingness to trust citizen science data generated by students.

Large biodiversity datasets conform to Benford's law: Implications for assessing sampling heterogeneity	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Biodiversity data; Citizen science; Community science; First-digit frequency; Numeric data; Reliability; Species occurrences	SPECIES ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTIONS; CITIZEN SCIENCE; EXTRAPOLATION; RAREFACTION; COMPLETENESS; INVENTORIES; RICHNESS; COVERAGE	Inadequate sampling can cause biased estimates of species diversity, as species occurrence generally follows a log-normal distribution with a long tail. Understanding this sampling bias is fundamental to inform biodiversity conservation actions. However, currently available tests to assess data quality, such as fitting species abundance distribution (SAD) models and rarefaction curves are computationally costly and can still lead to erroneous conclusions. We evaluated Benford's law (first digit distribution) as a complementary method to assess data heterogeneity and survey coverage in large biodiversity datasets, including eBird data for 157 countries and three non-avian GBIF datasets. We also tested conformity to Benford's law of four simulated communities with different SAD models and four corrupted datasets with log-normal SAD. Finally, we evaluated the effect of including rare species in three datasets on the conformity to Benford's law and also compared Benford fit to the results of traditional methods to estimate survey completeness in seven datasets. Species-rich datasets with a large number of observations tended to obtain a good fit. Benford conformity can be a simple and sensitive measure of sampling evenness, complementing traditional methods to assess quality data in large-scale studies. Benford's test can reflect species abundance heterogeneity, especially in log-normally distributed data, but was not ideal to evaluate surveys completeness, as its results diverged from those of traditional methods.As the contribution of citizen science continues to increase in biodiversity monitoring, this fast and efficient method can play a critical role to assess the quality of datasets.

These recommendations are particularly important when engaging in collaborative or co-created citizen science projects with marginalized groups. We provide examples of how citizen science projects can be designed and adapted in ways that ensure that they follow The Golden Rule, and make them appealing to, and achievable for, a greater number of individuals in our diverse global society.

We conducted a year-long experimental study (n = 85) "in-thewild" to explore the effects of human-value orientations on the use of digital citizen-science tools. Participants took part in both the codesign and use of digital citizen-science tools in Lappeenranta, Finland from 2018-2019. Our statistical analysis finds evidence of relations between value orientations, sustained participation, and the number and quality of digital interactions. Specifically, we find that value orientations are linked with different usage patterns. For instance, people with a stronger openness-to-change (OTC) values tended to use the mobile application to check others' submissions, even when they had nothing to submit, whereas people with stronger security values mostly used the application when they had something relevant to submit. Further understanding the influence of human values in digital citizen science is a promising area for future research that could contribute to a) guide the design of incentive mechanisms, b) understand user experiences in online communities, and c) inform the design and evaluation of digital citizen-science technologies.

It is important to detect attacks fast and localize attackers, which can be hard if not impossible without dedicated sensing infrastructure. The notion of participatory sensing, or crowdsensing, is that a large ensemble of voluntary contributors provides the measurements, rather than relying on dedicated sensing infrastructure. This work considers embedded GNSS receivers to provide measurements for participatory jamming detection and localization. Specifically, this work proposes a novel jamming localization algorithm, based on participatory sensing, that exploits AGC and C/N-0 estimates from commercial GNSS receivers. The proposed algorithm does not require knowledge of the jamming power nor of the channels, but automatically estimates all parameters. The algorithm is shown to outperform similar state-of-the-art localization algorithms in relevant scenarios.

Since the quality of the sensing data is directly related to the performance of the workers, it is then crucial to enable effective participation for a large number of workers. In this paper, we propose a decentralized dynamic participation game framework for participatory sensing systems with heterogeneons sensing processes and smartphone workers. Based on economic studies, we characterize the behaviour of workers with the idea of correlated equilibrium. We propose a regret matching based participation algorithm to track the set of correlated equilibria in a distributed manner, where the knowledge of competitors' preference information is not required. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves good convergence and effective participation.

It is important to design an effective incentive strategy to attract enough users' participation to guarantee the success of participatory sensing applications. Most of existing incentive mechanisms lack sufficient evaluation on the feasibility and effectiveness in a practical application scenario. Although some recent studies consider several practical factors in psychology and sociology, and evaluate different incentive strategies in practical experiments, but still fail to consider the time and location dependence of sensing data or the long-term sensing data collection requirements. In this paper, we focus on a new participatory sensing application, namely to recruit users to take time and geo-tagged images of the sky for a long duration to build a large-scale dataset, which is used in the research on outdoor air quality level inference. Three incentive strategies, linear reward, competitive and random red envelope are considered. Furthermore, we explore to combine three incentive strategies in different orders to investigate their effects on long-term data collections and perform practical experiments in three universities for a long duration (6 weeks). A number of sky images are collected, from which we obtain some interesting insights, providing important guidelines for designing diversified incentive strategies for long-term participatory sensing data collections.

However, passive citizen science is a recent and promising methodology of crowdsourcing. Here, we review existing studies that used spontaneous posts shared by users on social media to obtain marine wildlife scientific data. We also present a critical analysis of passive citizen science using social media. Specifically, we (1) introduce marine citizen science and (2) analyze the advantages of passive citizen science compared with voluntary approaches. We also (3) present investigations that extracted information and produced knowledge for marine ecology and conservation through passive citizen science, (4) discuss best practices and opportunities, and (5) identify challenges of this approach. Although social media data may have inherent biases and diverse ethical issues, the data volume is generally large, and the benefits of obtaining observations at a low cost and in real time compensate for some shortcomings, which can sometimes be mitigated. Considering that the use of passive citizen science will continue to grow and be part of our daily lives, we expect the current review to be useful for future investigations.	[Nascimento, L.

Such applications have recently been termed participatory sensing. An important category of participatory sensing applications is one that construct maps of different phenomena (e.g., traffic speed, pollution) using vehicular participatory sensing. An example is sharing data from GPS-enabled cell-phones to map traffic or noise patterns. Concerns with data privacy are a key impediment to the proliferation of such applications. This paper presents theoretical foundations, a system implementation, and an experimental evaluation of a perturbation-based mechanism for ensuring privacy of location-tagged participatory sensing data while allowing correct reconstruction of community statistics of interest (computed from shared perturbed data). The system is applied to construct accurate traffic speed maps in a small campus town from shared GPS data of participating vehicles; where the individual vehicles are allowed to "lie" about their actual location and speed at all times. An extensive evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of the approach in concealing multi-dimensional, correlated; time-series data while allowing for accurate reconstruction of spatial statistics.

The design of a participatory sensing application confronts two challenges: "privacy" and "incentive" which are two conflicting objectives and deserve deeper attention. Inspired by physical currency circulation system, this paper firstly proposes E-cent, a unit bearer currency. It is exchangeable, and participants can utilize it to participate in tasks anonymously. By employing E-cent, we further propose an E-cent-based privacy-preserving incentive mechanism, called EPPI, which exploits a pledge-based participating protocol to encourage participants to participate without revealing privacy and prohibit participants from sending false data. EPPI also takes advantage of a dynamic reward allocation scheme to maximize the value of the services under a budget constraint. To the best of our knowledge, EPPI is the first attempt to build an incentive mechanism while maintaining the desired privacy-preserving in participatory sensing systems. Extensive simulation and analysis results show that EPPI can achieve high anonymity level and remarkable incentive effects.

Incentive mechanism plays a key role in stimulating both SPs and SUs to take part in the participatory sensing system. Most of previous works on the incentive mechanism design do not consider the social relationship of SUs, which may degrade the performance of the participatory sensing system. In this paper, we take the social relationship of SUs into consideration, and design a Social-Aware Incentive Mechanism (SAIM) which can achieve high system performance and satisfy the properties of individual rationality, budget balance, the completely truthful for SPs, and partially truthful for SUs. Simulation results show the better performance of the proposed incentive mechanism compared with two other counterparts in terms of social utility and social effect. Specifically, the proposed mechanism can improve the social utility by 12% and 16% compared with McAfee and random selection, respectively, with the number of smartphone users m = 100.

For popular applications, we can expect a huge number of users to both contribute with sensor data and request information from the system. In such scenario, scalability of data processing becomes a major issue. In this paper, we present a system for supporting participatory sensing applications that leverages cluster or cloud infrastructures to provide a scalable data processing infrastructure. We propose and evaluate three strategies for data processing in this architecture.

One important challenge in these settings is privacy preservation for participatory sensing data, such as user trajectories. This paper develops a participatory sensing system for Android smartphones and proposes an efficient approach for privacy preservation which enables users to disclose their trajectory information without compromising their privacy. Existing approaches for privacy-aware data sharing operate under the assumption that user data is maintained in a centralized database. In our work we assume that user data is generated and stored locally on the individual smartphone devices. Our technique is distributed and low cost. We present detailed experimental results to illustrate that our approach is practical, efficient and with low overhead.

To date, however, there are few experimental studies of behaviour change outcomes induced by citizen science. We assessed the effects of citizen science in ecological stream monitoring on participants' individual and collective behaviour and action intentions to protect streams beyond the immediate scope of the citizen science project. For this we applied a three-wave, quasi-experimental survey design with a citizen science treatment group (N = 213 participants of the project FLOW in Germany) and two control groups (waiting control group: N = 92, panel control group: N = 250). In addition, we analysed citizen science effects on potential predictors of freshwater conservation behaviour, such as knowledge, skills, awareness of stream stressors and group identification. Results of linear mixed-model analysis showed that, compared to the control groups, citizen scientists significantly increased their objective stream-related knowledge, their self-reported stream monitoring skills and their awareness of stream stressors. These changes remained stable 6 weeks after the citizen science intervention. Notably, citizen scientists also reported increased identification with their citizen science project group and higher levels of collective and personal behaviour to protect streams at posttest (e.g. contacting local politicians with ideas for stream protection or using biodegradable detergents). Analysis revealed that increases in group identification and collective stream protection behaviour were significantly correlated. We could show that the citizen science intervention was particularly effective for participants with high intrinsic motivation and for those with low prior knowledge and experience in stream monitoring. Synthesis and applications. Citizen science can serve as a useful tool to promote ecological understanding, awareness and collective action to conserve freshwater streams. By fostering volunteer skills and community building, citizen science projects can empower participants with different levels of experience to engage in freshwater monitoring and protection. Decision makers should actively support approaches for citizen participation in freshwater monitoring, recognising that collective engagement of diverse community members is needed to finally meet the European Water Framework Directive's goal of restoring the good ecological status of freshwater ecosystems.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog. Citizen Science (,,B & uuml;rgerforschung") hat gro ss es Potenzial, das & ouml;kologische Wissen, die F & auml;higkeiten und das kollektive Handeln zum Erhalt der biologischen Vielfalt zu f & ouml;rdern. Bisher gibt es jedoch nur wenige experimentelle Studien zu den Auswirkungen von Citizen Science auf das umweltbezogene Verhalten der Teilnehmenden. Wir untersuchten die Auswirkungen von Citizen Science im & ouml;kologischen Flie ss gew & auml;ssermonitoring auf das individuelle und kollektive Verhalten und die Handlungsabsichten der Teilnehmenden im Bereich Gew & auml;sserschutz. Dazu verwendeten wir ein dreistufiges, quasi-experimentelles Studiendesign mit einer Citizen Science-Treatmentgruppe (N = 213 Teilnehmende des Projekts FLOW) und zwei Kontrollgruppen (Wartekontrollgruppe: N = 92, Panelkontrollgruppe: N = 250). Dar & uuml;ber hinaus analysierten wir die Auswirkungen von Citizen Science auf potenzielle Pr & auml;diktoren des Gew & auml;sserschutzverhaltens, wie z. B. Wissen, F & auml;higkeiten, Bewusstsein f & uuml;r Gew & auml;sserbelastungen und Gruppenidentifikation. Die Ergebnisse der linearen Modellanalyse zeigten, dass die B & uuml;rgerforschenden im Vergleich zu den Kontrollgruppen ihr objektives Wissen & uuml;ber Flie ss gew & auml;sser, ihre selbsteingesch & auml;tzten F & auml;higkeiten zum Flie ss gew & auml;ssermonitoring und ihr Bewusstsein f & uuml;r Gew & auml;sserbelastungen deutlich verbesserten. Diese Ver & auml;nderungen blieben auch sechs Wochen nach der Citizen Science-Intervention stabil. Die B & uuml;rgerforschenden berichteten im Posttest nach der Projektteilnahme auch & uuml;ber eine st & auml;rkere Identifikation mit ihrer Projektgruppe und & uuml;ber ein h & ouml;heres Ma ss an kollektivem und pers & ouml;nlichem Verhalten zum Schutz von Flie ss gew & auml;ssern (z.B. Kontaktaufnahme zur Lokalpolitik mit eigenen Ideen zum Gew & auml;sserschutz oder Verwendung biologisch abbaubarer Reinigungsmittel). Die Analyse ergab, dass die Zunahme der Gruppenidentifikation und des kollektiven Gew & auml;sserschutzverhaltens signifikant miteinander korrelierten. Wir konnten zeigen, dass die Citizen Science-Intervention besonders effektiv f & uuml;r Teilnehmende mit hoher intrinsischer Motivation und f & uuml;r Teilnehmende mit geringen Vorkenntnissen und Erfahrungen im Gew & auml;ssermonitoring war. Synthese und Anwendung. Citizen Science ist ein wertvolles Instrument zur F & ouml;rderung von & ouml;kologischen Kompetenzen und kollektivem Handeln zum Schutz von Flie ss gew & auml;ssern. Durch die F & ouml;rderung der Kompetenzen von B & uuml;rgerforschenden und den Aufbau einer aktiven Gemeinschaft k & ouml;nnen Citizen Science-Projekte Teilnehmende mit unterschiedlichen Erfahrungshintergr & uuml;nden in die Lage versetzen, sich am Flie ss gew & auml;ssermonitoring und -schutz zu beteiligen. Entscheidungstr & auml;ger:innen sollten Ans & auml;tze zur B & uuml;rgerbeteiligung im Flie ss gew & auml;ssermonitoring aktiv unterst & uuml;tzen. Denn das gemeinsame Engagement verschiedener gesellschaftlicher Akteure ist notwendig, um das Ziel der Europ & auml;ischen Wasserrahmenrichtlinie zu erreichen, den guten & ouml;kologischen Zustand von Gew & auml;ssern wiederherzustellen.

But, the quality of volunteer-collected data is often called into question, and citizen science programs must find ways to assess the validity of this concern. Here, we review five years of volunteer-collected data from an alpine flower monitoring citizen science project and present our efforts to investigate the quality of the volunteer-collected data. We found disparity between citizen scientists' self-assessed and actual plant species identification skills, indicating error in either true plant identification or reported location, consequently limiting the use of this dataset. Citizen science programs, including this project, must assess their data, and then make adjustments in training, data collection methods, or goals in order to produce quality data consistent with their scientific intentions. Indeed, this project now relies only on observations from seasonal trained staff and a handful of skilled volunteers in light of these findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Within a particular Canadian context of declining governmental environmental monitoring, this chapter explores the ideal of enhanced civic participation and experience gained through a long-term citizen science project. We offer this as one possible expression of activism. Drawing on specific tree planting and long-term monitoring programs established by the Association for Canadian Educational Resources (Climate's Sake) as an illustration of citizen science, we argue that these programs offer opportunities for those involved to increase their knowledge of local ecologies, share concerns and potentially contest local forest policies and management approaches linked with climate change and biodiversity conservation. We conclude by highlighting some associated tensions and contradictions.

Citizen-science projects often use web-based systems to support collaborative scientific activities, making them a form of computer-supported cooperative work. However, finding ways to attract participants and confirm the veracity of the data they produce are key issues in making such systems successful. We describe a series of web-based tools and games currently under development to support taxonomic classification of organisms in photographs collected by citizen-science projects. In the design science tradition, the systems are purpose-built to test hypotheses about participant motivation and techniques for ensuring data quality.

Citizen science applied to building healthier community environments: advancing the field through shared construct and measurement development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY			English	Article						Community; Constructs; Measures; Our voice; Residents; Stanford healthy neighborhood discovery tool	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY LEVELS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; OLDER-ADULTS; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; CIVIC ENGAGEMENT; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS	Background: Physical inactivity across the lifespan remains a public health issue for many developed countries. Inactivity has contributed considerably to the pervasiveness of lifestyle diseases. Government, national and local agencies and organizations have been unable to systematically, and in a coordinated way, translate behavioral research into practice that makes a difference at a population level. One approach for mobilizing multi-level efforts to improve the environment for physical activity is to engage in a process of citizen science. Citizen Science here is defined as a participatory research approach involving members of the public working closely with research investigators to initiate and advance scientific research projects. However, there are no common measures or protocols to guide citizen science research at the local community setting. Objectives: We describe overarching categories of constructs that can be considered when designing citizen science projects expected to yield multi-level interventions, and provide an example of the citizen science approach to promoting PA. We also recommend potential measures across different levels of impact. Discussion: Encouraging some consistency in measurement across studies will potentially accelerate the efficiency with which citizen science participatory research provides new insights into and solutions to the behaviorally-based public health issues that drive most of morbidity and mortality. The measures described in this paper abide by four fundamental principles specifically selected for inclusion in citizen science projects: feasibility, accuracy, propriety, and utility. The choice of measures will take into account the potential resources available for outcome and process evaluation. Our intent is to emphasize the importance for all citizen science participatory projects to follow an evidence-based approach and ensure that they incorporate an appropriate assessment protocol. Conclusions: We provided the rationale for and a list of contextual factors along with specific examples of measures to encourage consistency among studies that plan to use a citizen science participatory approach. The potential of this approach to promote health and wellbeing in communities is high and we hope that we have provided the tools needed to optimally promote synergistic gains in knowledge across a range of Citizen Science participatory projects.

Adopting Rose's discourse analysis I, this study examines various websites and documents related to post-Fukushima citizen science initiatives and illuminates how the data site developed its citizen-science-based memory practices. This research shows how the site provided a specific way of remembering the Fukushima disaster, which pushed against the notion of the Recovery Olympics. Also, it demonstrates that an important element in digital memory practices was using the Chernobyl nuclear disaster to help remember the past and mold the present.

J	Ekström, B				Ekstrom, Bjorn			A niche of their own: variations of information practices in biodiversity citizen science	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Citizen science; Information practices; Practice theory; Variation; Biodiversity; Information science	PARTICIPATION; LIFE	Purpose Information practices become highly complex in biodiversity citizen science projects due to the projects' large scale, distributed setting and vast inclusion of participants. This study aims to contribute to knowledge concerning what variations of information practices can be found in biodiversity citizen science and what these practices may mean for the overall collaborative biodiversity data production in such projects. Design/methodology/approach Fifteen semi-structured interviews were carried out with participants engaged with the Swedish biodiversity citizen science information system Artportalen. The empirical data were analysed through a practice-theoretical lens investigating information practices in general and variations of practices in particular. Findings The analysis shows that the nexus of biodiversity citizen science information practices consists of observing, identifying, reporting, collecting, curating and validating species as well as decision-making. Information practices vary depending on participants' technical know-how; knowledge production and learning; and preservation motivations. The study also found that reporting tools and field guides are significant for the formation of information practices. Competition was found to provide data quantity and knowledge growth but may inflict data bias. Finally, a discrepancy between practices of validating and decision-making have been noted, which could be mitigated by involving intermediary participants for mutual understandings of data. Originality/value The study places an empirically grounded information practice-theoretical perspective on citizen science participation, extending previous research seeking to model participant activities. Furthermore, the study nuances previous practice-oriented perspectives on citizen science by emphasising variations of practices.

J	Xu, L; Qiao, JZ; Lin, SK; Wang, XW				Xu, Ling; Qiao, Jianzhong; Lin, Shukuan; Wang, Xiaowei			Research on the Task Assignment Problem with Maximum Benefits in Volunteer Computing Platforms	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						volunteer computing; task assignment; deadline constraints; maximum benefit; asymmetric multiprocessing system	ALLOCATION; ALGORITHM; RELIABILITY; DUPLICATION; GRAPHS	As a type of distributed computing, volunteer computing (VC) has provided unlimited computing capacity at a low cost in recent decades. The architecture of most volunteer computing platforms (VCPs) is a master-worker model, which defines a master-slave relationship. Therefore, VCPs can be considered asymmetric multiprocessing systems (AMSs). As AMSs, VCPs are very promising for providing computing services for users. Users can submit tasks with deadline constraints to the VCPs. If the tasks are completed within their deadlines, VCPs will obtain the benefits. For this application scenario, this paper proposes a new task assignment problem with the maximum benefits in VCPs for the first time. To address the problem, we first proposed a list-based task assignment (LTA) strategy, and we proved that the LTA strategy could complete the task with a deadline constraint as soon as possible. Then, based on the LTA strategy, we proposed a maximum benefit scheduling (MBS) algorithm, which aimed at maximizing the benefits of VCPs. The MBS algorithm determined the acceptable tasks using a pruning strategy. Finally, the experiment results show that our proposed algorithm is more effective than current algorithms in the aspects of benefits, task acceptance rate and task completion rate.

The emergence of low-cost portable sensor technologies and proliferation of publicly available datasets provides unparalleled access to supporting evidence; yet data collection, analysis, interpretation, visualization, and communication are subjective approaches that must be tailored to a decision-making audience capable of improving environmental health. A decade of collaborative efforts and two citizen science projects contributed to three lessons learned and a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) that address the complexities of environmental health and interpersonal relations often encountered in citizen science EHAs. Each project followed a structured step-by-step process in order to compare and contrast methods and approaches. These lessons and FAQs provide advice to translate citizen science research into actionable solutions in the context of a diverse range of environmental health issues and local stakeholders.

Based on 127 projects identified for the North Sea area we estimate there might be as much as 500 marine and coastal citizen science projects running in Europe, i.e., one marine citizen science project per similar to 85 km of coastline, with an exponential growth since 1990. Beach-based projects are more accessible and hence most popular (60% of the projects), and the mean duration of the projects is 18-20 years. Current trends, topics, organizers, aims, and types of programme in terms of participation are presented in this overview. Progress in marine citizen science is specially enabled and promoted through technological developments. Recent technological advances and best practise examples are provided here, untapping the potential of smart mobile apps, do-it-yourself (DIY) technologies, drones, and artificial intelligence (AI) web services.

Therefore, this study was conducted to document the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of biology teachers who participated in a citizen science project involving observation of wild bees and identification of butterflies. In this paper, knowledge about how these biological methods can be taught to students is presented. After two years in the project, four teachers were interviewed and their PCK was captured in the form of content representations (CoRes) and Pedagogical and Professional-Experience Repertoires (PaP-eRs). These results can help future citizen science projects to link their activities to the school curriculum. But not only success can be reported: although one of the project team's aims was to make the Nature of Science accessible to the teachers and students in the course of the project, the teachers did not take this aspect into account. This paper discusses the possible reasons and proposes various strategies for improving citizen science in the context of school biology learning.

Yet its potential for driving transformative learning is empirically underexplored. We present the results of a preliminary study with secondary school students engaged in a long-term citizen science project, from the formulation of the research questions to data analysis and discussion. Students learnt about and increased their interest in neuroscience. They were also able to reflect on the role of science for society and valued their involvement as active participants in the research. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of approaching citizen science for transformative learning.

To address this, we introduced a bird-focused research experience into an undergraduate Wildlife Management Techniques course. The objective of this course is to provide practical experiences in wildlife science by learning and using tools and techniques applied in the field. Students designed, implemented, and presented the results of a wild bird observation survey that contributed data to an existing e-Bird-based program. Pre-post surveys were collected to assess student learning and behavioral changes. We observed increased student awareness of citizen science. Ninety-two percent of students correctly defined citizen science following the experience. However, only sixteen percent of students stated they would continue participation in STWB, fifty percent were unsure, and thirty-four percent would not continue involvement. Improvements are discussed to promote participation in citizen science, connections with the community, and communication skill development for future employment.

As species shift their distributions globally due to climate change, the use of citizen science data to detect these shifts is increasing. Using targeted citizen science programs to collect data on these species could provide information on range edges to inform species distribution modelling. Currently, species distribution models (SDMs) often rely on large data repositories that may lack observations, and hence ability, to detect changes at the range edge. Here, we developed a SDM to compare traditional data repository observations with targeted citizen science data at the southern distribution limit of two recreationally important marine fish in Tasmania, Australia to investigate the potential change in spatial predictions at their range edge. The SDM using the targeted citizen science data in addition to traditional observation data improved the representation of species by 2.3 and 52.7% and increased the southern distribution of the species by 277 and 438 km, for snapper and King George whiting, respectively. Future (centred around 2050 under IPCC RCP 8.5) habitat suitability was predicted to increase more over the winter season, with implications for species overwintering and persistence of populations. The use of citizen science data allowed for the modelling of historical and future change for two range -extending species, an outcome possible due to the collaboration of two citizen science programs that collected observational data on the target species. Species range shifts will require ongoing monitoring and we have demonstrated that complimentary citizen science initiatives are effective in capturing occurrences of species at their range edge. Increasing collaboration between programs may further increase data collection efforts and provide the knowledge to create a hub for these data to be used more efficiently in the future.

We need a better understanding of how the varied restrictions have impacted wildlife monitoring as gaps in data continuity caused by these disruptions may limit future data use and analysis. To assess the effect of different levels of COVID-19 restrictions on both citizen science and traditional wildlife monitoring, we analyse observational records of a widespread and iconic monotreme, the Australian short beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), in three states of Australia. We compare citizen science to observations from biodiversity data repositories across the three states by analysing numbers of observations, coverage in protected areas, and geographic distribution using an index of remoteness and accessibility. We analyse the effect of restriction levels by comparing these data from each restriction level in 2020 with corresponding periods in 2018-2019. Our results indicate that stricter and longer restrictions reduced numbers of scientific observations while citizen science showed few effects, though there is much variation due to differences in restriction levels in each state. Geographic distribution and coverage of protected and non-protected areas were also reduced for scientific monitoring while citizen science observations were little affected. This study shows that citizen science can continue to record accurate and widely distributed species observational data, despite pandemic restrictions, and thus demonstrates the potential value of citizen science to other researchers who require reliable data during periods of disruption.

Citizen Science is facing major challenges, such as quality and consistency, to reap open the full potential of its outputs and outcomes, including data, software and results. In this context, the principles put forth by Data Science and Open Science domains are essential for alleviating these challenges, which have been addressed at length in these domains. The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which Citizen Science initiatives capitalise on Data Science and Open Science principles. Design/methodology/approach The authors analysed 48 Citizen Science projects related to pollution and its effects. They compared each project against a set of Data Science and Open Science indicators, exploring how each project defines, collects, analyses and exploits data to present results and contribute to knowledge. Findings The results indicate several shortcomings with respect to commonly accepted Data Science principles, including lack of a clear definition of research problems and limited description of data management and analysis processes, and Open Science principles, including lack of the necessary contextual information for reusing project outcomes. Originality/value In the light of this analysis, the authors provide a set of guidelines and recommendations for better adoption of Data Science and Open Science principles in Citizen Science projects, and introduce a software tool to support this adoption, with a focus on preparation of data management plans in Citizen Science projects.

Ants' ubiquity and diversity, their role as ecological bioindicators, and the fact that most species can easily be sampled makes them ideal candidates for this kind of studies. In the framework of the international School of Ants citizen science project, we joined the "BioBlitz Lombardia" in which citizens are invited to collect biodiversity data on several parks from Lombardy (Po Plain, Italy). As a result, we recorded 30 ant species and obtained a first characterization of the region's ant assemblages. We studied their patterns of variation in relation with the ecological difference between the studies sites, which ranged from urban to subalpine areas. In addition, we detected the presence of a cryptic species (Tetramorium immigrans) whose distribution and identity were only recently clarified. It likely represents an under-recorded introduced species in the region. Advantages and critical aspects of using CS methodology for the study of biodiversity are discussed in light of our experience. Ants are considered a useful model for biodiversity monitoring and several of their characteristics make them promising for citizen science (CS) projects. Involving a wide range of public figures into collecting valuable data on the effect of human impact on ant biodiversity, the School of Ants (SoA) project represents one of the very few attempts to explore the potential of these insects in CS. Through the collaboration with the "BioBlitz Lombardia" project, we tested the SoA protocol on 12 Northern Italy parks, ranging from urban green to subalpine protected sites. As a result, we obtained some of the very first quantitative data characterizing the ants of this region, recording 30 species and highlighting some interesting ecological patterns. These data revealed the ubiquitous presence of the recently taxonomically defined cryptic species Tetramorium immigrans, which appears to be probably introduced in the region. We also discuss advantages and criticisms encountered applying the SoA protocol, originally intended for schools, to new categories of volunteers, from BioBlitz participants to park operators, suggesting best practices based on our experience.

Following the introduction of virtualisation with BOINC to run HEP Linux software in a virtual machine on volunteer desktops, initially started on test BOINC projects, like Test4Theory and ATLAS @ home, all CERN applications distributed to volunteers have been consolidated under a single LHC @ home BOINC project. As part of an effort to unite CERN's batch, cloud, grid and volunteer computing efforts, the BOINC service has been integrated with the other compute services at CERN, notably HTCondor, in terms job submission and accounting. The paper will also address contributions to improve the BOINC software and community effort to evolve BOINC for a sustainable volunteer computing environment. Furthermore, we discuss future challenges to reduce the effort required by volunteers to run virtual machines for experiment simulations and improvements to BOINC to widen the appeal of volunteer computing.

Since a significant improvement in performance of such computers, updating the equipment is performed frequently. In Japan, solar photovoltaic is widely used, and the solar panels are installed to the roof of the ordinary houses. About 20 years later, solar panels will become the industrial waste. In the research stage, they are recycled at a high efficiency. Before the high efficiency of recycling is to progress to the commercial stage, there is a possibility that a large amount of solar panels are discarded. In this work, with considering the Green ICT, we use the instruments that become a waste again, and are suppressing the energy consumption cost. On that basis, we will consider the implementation of energy-aware volunteer computing.

Changing perspectives: tracing the evolution of citizen radiation measuring organizations after Fukushima	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						Fukushima nuclear accident; bottom-up citizen science; post-disaster recovery		Although bottom-up citizen science in the field of radiation monitoring is not a new phenomenon, the organizations established in the wake of the Fukushima accident exceed preceding organizations in numbers, in space and in data production. Almost 10 years after the Fukushima nuclear accident, citizen radiation measuring organizations continue their activities stressing the importance of transparency, education and participation, despite the issues they are facing. Drawing on research on citizen science and results from fieldwork conducted in Japan, this paper reflects on the evolution of grassroots citizen science initiatives, contrasting their activities in the immediate aftermath of the Fukushima disaster to present day. By showing how some organizations have grown and others faded away, it demonstrates the intertwining and flexibility of citizen science initiatives in addressing concerns and needs expressed by local communities.

Citizen science has existed for centuries, but the recent adoption of information and communications technology (ICT) in this field (e.g. web- or mobile application-based interfaces for citizen training and data generation) has led to a massive surge in popularity, mainly due to reduced geographic barriers to citizen participation. Several challenges exist, however, to effectively utilize citizen-generated data for monitoring IAS (or other species of interest) at the global scale. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of citizen science initiatives collecting IAS data using ICT, hoping to better understand their scientific contributions and challenges, their similarities/differences, and their interconnections. Through a search of the Scopus database, we identified 26 initiatives whose data had been used in scientific publications related to IAS, and based our analyses on these initiatives. The most common scientific uses of these citizen science data were to visualize the spatial distribution of IAS, better understand their behaviour/phenology, and elucidate citizen science data quality issues. To alleviate data quality concerns, most initiatives (19/26) had mechanisms for verifying citizen observations, such as user-submitted photographs. While many initiatives collected similar data parameters for each species observation, only 54% of the initiatives had a practice of data sharing. This lack of data sharing causes fragmentation of the citizen-generated IAS data, and is likely inhibiting the wider usage of the data for scientific studies on IAS involving large geographic scales (e.g. regional or global) and/or broad taxonomic scopes. To reduce this fragmentation and better consolidate the collected citizen science data, finally we provide some general data sharing guidelines for citizen science initiatives as well as individual volunteers.

However, computing devices in a Volunteer Computing System (VCS) are highly dynamic and heterogeneous in terms of their processing power, monetary cost, and data transferring latency. To ensure both of the high Quality of Service (QoS) and low cost for different requests, all of the available computing resources must be used efficiently. Task scheduling is an NP-hard problem that is considered as one of the main critical challenges in a heterogeneous VCS. Due to this, in this article, we design two task scheduling algorithms for VCSs, named Min-CCV and Mtn-V. The main goal of the proposed algorithms is jointly minimizing the computation, communication, and delay violation cost for the Internet of Things (IoT) requests. Our extensive simulation results show that proposed algorithms are able to allocate tasks to volunteer fog/cloud resources more efficiently than the state-of-the-art. Specifically, our algorithms improve the deadline satisfaction task rates around 99.5% and decrease the total cost between 15 to 53% in comparison with the genetic-based algorithm.

Leveraging the power of place in citizen science for effective conservation decision making	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Citizen science; Power of place; Place-based citizen science; Integrated citizen science; Social-ecological systems; Conservation decision making; Open science; GIS; Open data	PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION; CHALLENGES; ENVIRONMENT; INFORMATION; SCALE; SENSE	Many citizen science projects are place-based - built on in-person participation and motivated by local conservation. When done thoughtfully, this approach to citizen science can transform humans and their environment. Despite such possibilities, many projects struggle to meet decision-maker needs, generate useful data to inform decisions, and improve social-ecological resilience. Here, we define leveraging the 'power of place' in citizen science, and posit that doing this improves conservation decision making, increases participation, and improves community resilience. First, we explore 'place' and identify five place dimensions: social-ecological, narrative and name-based, knowledge-based, emotional and affective, and performative. We then thematically analyze 134 case studies drawn from CitSci.org (n = 39), The Stewardship Network New England (TSN-NE; n = 39), and Earthwatch (n = 56) regarding: (1) use of place dimensions in materials (as one indication of leveraging the power of place), (2) intent for use of data in decision-making, and (3) evidence of such use. We find that 89% of projects intend for data to be used, 46% demonstrate no evidence of use, and 54% provide some evidence of use. Moreover, projects used in decision making leverage more (t = 4.8, df = 117; p < 0.001) place dimensions ((x) over bar= 3.0; s = 1.4) than those not used in decision making ((x) over bar =1.8; s =1.2). Further, a Principal Components Analysis identifies three related components (aesthetic, narrative and name-based, and social-ecological). Given these findings, we present a framework for leveraging place in citizen science projects and platforms, and recommend approaches to better impart intended outcomes. We discuss place in citizen science related to relevance, participation, resilience, and scalability and conclude that effective decision making as a means towards more resilient and sustainable communities can be strengthened by leveraging the power of place in citizen science.

Artificial Intelligence Meets Citizen Science to Supercharge Ecological Monitoring	PATTERNS			English	Review							CONSERVATION; EXTINCTION; CHALLENGES; BENEFITS; SHIFTS; EBIRD; TOOL	The development and uptake of citizen science and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for ecological monitoring is increasing rapidly. Citizen science and AI allow scientists to create and process larger volumes of data than possible with conventional methods. However, managers of large ecological monitoring projects have little guidance on whether citizen science, AI, or both, best suit their resource capacity and objectives. To highlight the benefits of integrating the two techniques and guide future implementation by managers, we explore the opportunities, challenges, and complementarities of using citizen science and AI for ecological monitoring. We identify project attributes to consider when implementing these techniques and suggest that financial resources, engagement, participant training, technical expertise, and subject charisma and identification are important project considerations. Ultimately, we highlight that integration can supercharge outcomes for ecological monitoring, enhancing cost-efficiency, accuracy, and multi-sector engagement.

To protect ground-nesting birds in farmland, monitoring and mitigating impacts of mechanical harvesting is crucial. Here, we use 6years of data from a nationwide volunteer-based monitoring scheme of the Montagu's harrier, a ground-nesting raptor, in French farmlands. We assess the effectiveness of alternative nest protection measures and map their potential benefit to the species. We show that unprotected nests in cultivated land are strongly negatively affected by harvesting and thus require active management. Further, we show that protection from harvesting alone (e.g. by leaving a small unharvested buffer around the nest) is impaired by post-harvest predation at nests that become highly conspicuous after harvest. Measures that simultaneously protect from harvesting and predation (by adding a fence around the nest) significantly enhance nest productivity. The map of expected gain from nest protection in relation to available volunteers' workforce pinpoints large areas of high expected gain from nest protection that are not matched by equally high workforce availability. This mismatch suggests that the impact of nest protection can be further improved by increasing volunteer efforts in key areas where they are low relative to the expected gain they could have.Synthesis and applications. This study shows that synergistic interplay of multiple factors (e.g. mechanical harvesting and predation) may completely undermine the success of well-intentioned conservation efforts. However, identifying areas where the greatest expected gains can be achieved relative to effort expended can minimize the risk of wasted volunteer actions. Overall, this study underscores the importance of citizen science for collecting large-scale data useful for producing science and ultimately informs large-scale evidence-based conservation actions within an adaptive management framework.

BOINC is the main middleware system for this type of distributed computing. The aim of volunteer computing is that organizations be able to attain large computing power thanks to the participation of volunteer clients instead of a high investment in infrastructure. There are projects, like the ATLAS@Home project, in which the number of running jobs has reached a plateau, due to a high load on data servers caused by file transfer. This is why we have designed an alternative, using the same BOINC infrastructure, in order to improve the performance of BOINC projects that have reached their limit due to the I/O bottleneck in data servers. This alternative involves having a percentage of the volunteer clients running as data servers, called data volunteers, that improve the performance of the system by reducing the load on data servers. In addition, our solution takes advantage of data locality, leveraging the low network latencies of closer machines. This paper describes our alternative in detail and shows the performance of the solution, applied to 3 different BOINC projects, using a simulator of our own, ComBoS.

J	Katapally, TR				Katapally, Tarun Reddy			The SMART Framework: Integration of Citizen Science, Community-Based Participatory Research, and Systems Science for Population Health Science in the Digital Age	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						community-based participatory research; smartphones; mobile phones; population health; mHealth; eHealth; big data; evidence-based framework; citizen science; systems science; ubiquitous tools	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; BIG DATA; POLICY; MODEL; TOOL; CHALLENGES; KNOWLEDGE; CAPACITY; THINKING; IMPROVE	Citizen science is gradually emerging as a pertinent approach in population health research. Given that citizen science has intrinsic links with community-based research, where participatory action drives the research agenda, these two approaches could be integrated to address complex population health issues. Community-based participatory research has a strong record of application across multiple disciplines and sectors to address health inequities. Citizen science can use the structure of community-based participatory research to take local approaches of problem solving to a global scale, because citizen science emerged through individual environmental activism that is not limited by geography. This synergy has significant implications for population health research if combined with systems science, which can offer theoretical and methodological strength to citizen science and community-based participatory research. Systems science applies a holistic perspective to understand the complex mechanisms underlying causal relationships within and between systems, as it goes beyond linear relationships by utilizing big data-driven advanced computational models. However, to truly integrate citizen science, community-based participatory research, and systems science, it is time to realize the power of ubiquitous digital tools, such as smartphones, for connecting us all and providing big data. Smartphones have the potential to not only create equity by providing a voice to disenfranchised citizens but smartphone-based apps also have the reach and power to source big data to inform policies. An imminent challenge in legitimizing citizen science is minimizing bias, which can be achieved by standardizing methods and enhancing data quality-a rigorous process that requires researchers to collaborate with citizen scientists utilizing the principles of community-based participatory research action. This study advances SMART, an evidence-based framework that integrates citizen science, community-based participatory research, and systems science through ubiquitous tools by addressing core challenges such as citizen engagement, data management, and internet inequity to legitimize this integration.

The majority of these Volunteer Computing (VC) platforms are based on client-server architecture, therefore susceptible to server-side bottlenecks and delays in project completion due to lost Workload Units (WU). This paper presents a new model for a computing platform that offloads the tasks of WU creation from centralized servers to the network nodes and with the use of a remote checkpoint system, it can re-create lost WUs from failed or unavailable nodes. With these improvements, it can achieve better scaling and load balancing, and due to the checkpoints, only a limited amount of computation is lost due to node failure. Simulation results of the model's behavior are also present and interpreted.

Cheat detection is necessary to prevent dishonest participants from receiving credit points, without actually providing these resources. We suggest a novel, scalable approach for cheat detection in decentralized volunteer computing systems using gossip communication. Each honest participant adapts its detection effort dynamically subject to the number of active participants, which we estimate based on observed system performance. This enables minimizing the detection overhead for each participant, while still achieving a high preselected detection rate for the overall system. Systems based on majority voting usually produce at least 100% overhead, whereas our approach, e.g. requires only 50.6% overhead in a network with 1 000 participants to achieve a 99.9% detection rate. Since our approach does not require trusted entities or an active cooperation between participants, it is robust even against colluding cheaters.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE; COLLECTIVE IDENTIFICATION; VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; MOTIVATIONS; KNOWLEDGE; DEVELOPERS; REPOSITORIES; CONTEXT; TASK	Online citizen science offers a low-cost way to strengthen the infrastructure for scientific research and engage members of the public in science. As the sustainability of online citizen science projects depends on volunteers who contribute their skills, time, and energy, the objective of this study is to investigate effects of motivational factors on the quantity and quality of citizen scientists' contribution. Building on the social movement participation model, findings from a longitudinal empirical study in three different citizen science projects reveal that quantity of contribution is determined by collective motives, norm-oriented motives, reputation, and intrinsic motives. Contribution quality, on the other hand, is positively affected only by collective motives and reputation. We discuss implications for research on the motivation for participation in technology-mediated social participation and for the practice of citizen science.

Safari Science: assessing the reliability of citizen science data for wildlife surveys	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bayesian; citizen science; data reconciliation; East Africa; hierarchical modelling; monitoring; protected areas; uncertainty; validation; wildlife surveys	PROTECTED AREAS; MARA REGION; POPULATION DECLINES; ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; LAND-COVER; TOOL; CONSERVATION; VOLUNTEERS; WILDEBEEST; MANAGEMENT	1. Protected areas are the cornerstone of global conservation, yet financial support for basic monitoring infrastructure is lacking in 60% of them. Citizen science holds potential to address these shortcomings in wildlife monitoring, particularly for resource-limited conservation initiatives in developing countries - if we can account for the reliability of data produced by volunteer citizen scientists (VCS). 2. This study tests the reliability of VCS data vs. data produced by trained ecologists, presenting a hierarchical framework for integrating diverse datasets to assess extra variability from VCS data. 3. Our results show that while VCS data are likely to be overdispersed for our system, the overdispersion varies widely by species. We contend that citizen science methods, within the context of East African drylands, may be more appropriate for species with large body sizes, which are relatively rare, or those that form small herds. VCS perceptions of the charisma of a species may also influence their enthusiasm for recording it. 4. Tailored programme design (such as incentives for VCS) may mitigate the biases in citizen science data and improve overall participation. However, the cost of designing and implementing high-quality citizen science programmes may be prohibitive for the small protected areas that would most benefit from these approaches. 5. Synthesis and applications. As citizen science methods continue to gain momentum, it is critical that managers remain cautious in their implementation of these programmes while working to ensure methods match data purpose. Context-specific tests of citizen science data quality can improve programme implementation, and separate data models should be used when volunteer citizen scientists' variability differs from trained ecologists' data. Partnerships across protected areas and between protected areas and other conservation institutions could help to cover the costs of citizen science programme design and implementation.

A Case Study of Delineating Polish Metropolitan Areas	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN RESEARCH			English	Article						Citizen Science; Social Trust; Trust in Science; Urban Studies; City Boundaries	SCIENTIFIC-RESEARCH; PUBLIC TRUST; ATTITUDES; REJECTION; KNOWLEDGE	We assess the relationship between citizens' participation in scientific research and public trust in research results within social sciences. We conduct an online citizen science quasi-experiment concerning the delineation of metropolitan areas of Poland's two major cities. It consists of two stages. In stage one, participants in one region are exposed to citizen science and directly involved in delineating the boundaries of their local metropolitan area. In stage two, we add another region in which participants are not involved in the research process. In both regions we ask the participants to evaluate the level of their trust in the presented maps of respective metropolitan areas: based on citizen science in one region and historical data regression analysis in the other region. Our contribution to the literature lies in two areas. First, we demonstrate how citizen science can be used in urban studies to delineate boundaries of urban and metropolitan areas exhibiting strong functional connections. Second, we show that the participation of local residents in the research process increases public trust in the study results compared to non-participatory 'traditional academic' research. These results confirm that citizen science programs deserve to be strongly supported by European institutions as a possible means to resolving the credibility crisis of science, research and evidence-based policies.

Since citizen science presence-only data suffer from some fundamental issues, efforts have been made to combine these data with those provided by scientifically structured surveys. Surprisingly, only a few studies proposing data integration evaluated the contribution of this process to the effective sampling of species' environmental niches and, consequently, its effect on model predictions on new time intervals. We relied on niche overlap analyses, machine learning classification algorithms and ecological niche models to compare the ability of data from citizen science and scientific surveys, along with their integration, in capturing the realized niche of 13 invasive alien species in Italy. Moreover, we assessed differences in current and future invasion risk predicted by each data set under multiple global change scenarios. We showed that data from citizen science and scientific surveys captured similar species niches though highlighting exclusive portions associated with clearly identifiable environmental conditions. In terrestrial species, citizen science data granted the highest gain in environmental space to the pooled niches, determining an increased future biological invasion risk. A few aquatic species modelled at the regional scale reported a net loss in the pooled niches compared to their scientific survey niches, suggesting that citizen science data may also lead to contraction in pooled niches. For these species, models predicted a lower future biological invasion risk. These findings indicate that citizen science data may represent a valuable contribution to predicting future spread of invasive alien species, especially within national-scale programmes. At the same time, citizen science data collected on species poorly known to citizen scientists, or in strictly local contexts, may strongly affect the niche quantification of these taxa and the prediction of their future biological invasion risk.

Nearby counties that may experience similar air quality do not have state or county monitors. This study utilized NOx and ozone Ogawa passive samplers and community scientists to monitor air quality in five counties surrounding Charlotte and increase public engagement in air quality issues. Community scientists deployed samplers weekly at a residential site within each county. Samples were analyzed using spectrophotometry and ion chromatography. Elevated NOx concentrations were observed in four of the five counties relative to those with existing monitors. Ozone concentrations showed little county to county variation, except Iredell and Cabarrus which had higher concentrations than Rowan. Community involvement in this work led to an increase in local dissemination of the results, thus increasing air quality awareness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Generally, citizen science can provide a complement to authoritative scientific practices for responding to this highly complex biological threat and its adverse consequences. Several citizen science projects have been designed and operationalized for responding to COVID-19 in Iran since the infection began. However, these projects have mostly been overlooked in the existing literature on citizen science. This research sheds light on the most significant online citizen science projects to respond to the COVID-19 crisis in Iran. Furthermore, it highlights some of the opportunities and challenges associated with the strengths and weaknesses of these projects. Moreover, this study captures and discusses some considerable insights and lessons learned from the failures and successes of these projects and provides solutions to overcome some recognized challenges and weaknesses of these projects. The outcomes of this synthesis provide potentially helpful directions for current and future citizen science projects-particularly those aiming to respond to biological disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Policies on sustainability in agriculture, especially in Latin America, forget that farmers can contribute knowledge and experience, which has generated a low rate of adoption of agroecological practices and consumption of chemical fertilizers that erode arable soils. Citizen Science, understood as a model of social participation defined by citizens and scientists who collaborate with each other, is proposed as a factor that allows farmers to become actors by sharing the knowledge acquired from tradition and practice, and linking it to the existing one. Based on theoretical proposals on the role of Citizen Science in governance and the report of the European Commission, a theoretical explanation is offered and in the conclusions the proposed operating mechanism in public policies for sustainable agriculture.

To bring a practical perspective into the dialogue, we designed a survey to obtain direct assessments of the contribution of citizen science to the SDGs by European project participants. We launched the survey across European science networks in 2020 and evaluated 125 questionnaires. Participants reported contributing most to three of the SDGs: 'Good health and well-being', 'Quality education', and Life on Land'. Additionally, our results provide evidence that, with ongoing advocacy, citizen science projects in Europe could support all SDGs in the future. Seventy-two percent of participants indicated that their projects are involved in data acquisition and 30% stated to report data, but 19% do not pass on data at all. Our findings indicate further that European citizen science projects lack infrastructures and institutional support to facilitate data sharing. We recommend a focus on the promotion or creation of interfaces, for example, between projects and UN databases. Finally, we advise that citizen science projects, some of which operate with little funding, should not be overburdened with inflated expectations as a means of implementing the SDGs.

This article presents the results of research that sought to contribute to the understanding of the role of citizen science, one of the axes of Open Science, to deal with issues posed by the pandemic. In addition to a literature review, the study involved identification and categorization of these citizen initiatives in Brazil during the COVID-19 outbreak. Mutual learning can be seen between citizen science approaches and participatory actions to reduce risks from disasters. On the one hand, this learning strengthens the role of citizens' production of data, information, and knowledge relevant for the prevention, resilience to, and management of these risks; and, on the other hand, it broadens the scope of citizen science to confront emergency and disaster situations while reinforcing the situated character of this approach.

Some recent developments, though, like the use of Artificial Intelligence to support data collection and validation, seem to point to a clear-cut divergence from the mainstream research path. The objective of this paper is to summarise the development trajectory of research on Citizen Science in Education so far, and then shed light on its future development, to help researchers direct their efforts towards the most promising open questions in this field. We achieved these objectives by using the lens of the Affordance-Actualisation theory and the Main Path Analysis method.

The new digital infrastructure of SciStarter includes integrated registration and contribution tracking tools to make it easier to participate in multiple projects, enhanced GIS information to promote locally relevant projects, an online personal dashboard to keep track of contributions, and the use of these tools (integrated registration, GIS, dashboard) by project owners and researchers to better understand and respond to the needs and interests of citizen-science participants. In this chapter, the authors explore how these new tools build pathways to participatory policymaking, expand access to informal STEM experiences, and lower barriers to citizen science. The chapter concludes with a design for a citizen-science future with increased access to tools, trackable participation, and integrated competencies.

Despite this heterogeneity, there are several common barriers to the uptake and sustainability of citizen science projects and the information they generate. One key barrier often cited in the citizen science literature is data quality. Open-source tools for the analysis, visualization, and reporting of citizen science data hold promise for addressing the challenge of data quality, while providing other benefits such as technical capacity-building, increased user engagement, and reinforcing data sovereignty. We developed an operational citizen science tool called the Community Water Data Analysis Tool (CWDAT)-a R/Shiny-based web application designed for community-based water quality monitoring. Surveys and facilitated user-engagement were conducted among stakeholders during the development of CWDAT. Targeted recruitment was used to gather feedback on the initial CWDAT prototype's interface, features, and potential to support capacity building in the context of community-based water quality monitoring. Fourteen of thirty-two invited individuals (response rate 44%) contributed feedback via a survey or through facilitated interaction with CWDAT, with eight individuals interacting directly with CWDAT. Overall, CWDAT was received favourably. Participants requested updates and modifications such as water quality thresholds and indices that reflected well-known barriers to citizen science initiatives related to data quality assurance and the generation of actionable information. Our findings support calls to engage end-users directly in citizen science tool design and highlight how design can contribute to users' understanding of data quality. Enhanced citizen participation in water resource stewardship facilitated by tools such as CWDAT may provide greater community engagement and acceptance of water resource management and policy-making.

The diversity and evolution of ecological and environmental citizen science	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; TOOL; KNOWLEDGE	Citizen science D the involvement of volunteers in data collection, analysis and interpretation D simultaneously supports research and public engagement with science, and its profile is rapidly rising. Citizen science represents a diverse range of approaches, but until now this diversity has not been quantitatively explored. We conducted a systematic internet search and discovered 509 environmental and ecological citizen science projects. We scored each project for 32 attributes based on publicly obtainable information and used multiple factor analysis to summarise this variation to assess citizen science approaches. We found that projects varied according to their methodological approach from 'mass participation' (e.g. easy participation by anyone anywhere) to 'systematic monitoring' (e.g. trained volunteers repeatedly sampling at specific locations). They also varied in complexity from approaches that are 'simple' to those that are ` elaborate' (e.g. provide lots of support to gather rich, detailed datasets). There was a separate cluster of entirely computer-based projects but, in general, we found that the range of citizen science projects in ecology and the environment showed continuous variation and cannot be neatly categorised into distinct types of activity. While the diversity of projects begun in each time period (pre 1990, 1990 - 99, 2000 - 09 and 2010 - 13) has not increased, we found that projects tended to have become increasingly different from each other as time progressed (possibly due to changing opportunities, including technological innovation). Most projects were still active so consequently we found that the overall diversity of active projects (available for participation) increased as time progressed. Overall, understanding the landscape of citizen science in ecology and the environment (and its change over time) is valuable because it informs the comparative evaluation of the ` success' of different citizen science approaches. Comparative evaluation provides an evidence- base to inform the future development of citizen science activities.

Credibility-based voting with spot-checking is a promising approach to the high-performance and reliable VC systems. In this approach, spot-check rate has a significant impact on the performance, which must be set before the computation. Therefore, the estimation of the optimal spot-check rate is the major concern to minimize the computation time. The key idea for the estimation is to represent the mathematical expectation of the computation time as a function of spot-check rate. Extensive simulation has shown that the proposed technique always obtains an approximate estimate of the optimal spot-check rate and minimizes the computation time with an uncertainty of 1%.

ZIVIS: A City Computing Platform Based on Volunteer Computing	IBERGRID: 1ST IBERIAN GRID INFRASTRUCTURE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	1st Iberian Infrastructure Conference (IBERGRID)	MAY 14-16, 2007	Santiago Compostela, SPAIN	Portuguese Ministry Sci Tech Higher Educ, Spanish Minist Educ & Sci, Bull, Dell, Fujitsu Siemens, HP, Intel, Sun Microsys, Telindus				Volunteer computing has come up as a new form of distributed computing. Unlike other computing paradigms like Grids, which use to be based on complex architectures, volunteer computing has demonstrated a great ability to integrate dispersed, heterogeneous computing resources with ease. This article presents ZIVIS, a project which aims to deploy a city-wide computing platform in Zaragoza (Spain). ZIVIS is based on BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing), a popular open source framework to deploy volunteer and desktop grid computing systems. A scientific code which simulates the trajectories of particles moving inside a stellarator fusion device, has been chosen as the pilot application of the project. In this paper we describe the approach followed to port the code to the BOINC framework as well as some novel techniques, based on standard Grid protocols, we have used to access the output data present in the BOINC server from a remote visualizer.

Ready, Set, Go: Community Science Field Campaign Reveals Habitat Preferences of Nonnative Asian Earthworms in an Urban Landscape	BIOSCIENCE			English	Article						citizen science; invasive species; Amynthas; earthworms; urban ecosystems		Asian pheretimoid earthworms of the genera Amynihas and Metaphire (jumping worms) are leading a new wave of coinvasion into Northeastern and Midwestern states, with potential consequences for native organisms and ecosystem processes. However, little is known about their distribution, abundance, and habitat preferences in urban landscapes-areas that will likely influence their range expansion via human-driven spread. We led a participatory field campaign to assess jumping worm distribution and abundance in Madison, Wisconsin, in the United States. By compressing 250 person-hours of sampling effort into a single day, we quantified the presence and abundance of three jumping worm species across different land-cover types (forest, grassland, open space, and residential lawns and gardens), finding that urban green spaces differed in invasibility. We show that community science can be powerful for researching invasive species while engaging the public in conservation. This approach was particularly effective in the present study, where broad spatial sampling was required within a short temporal window.

Unstructured citizen science data fail to detect long-term population declines of common birds in Denmark	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						citizen science; common bird monitoring; JAGS; occupancy model; population trend; volunteer	BIOLOGICAL RECORDS; OCCUPANCY MODELS; ABUNDANCE; TRENDS; PROGRAMS; ECOLOGY; EBIRD; BIAS	Aim Long-term monitoring of biodiversity is necessary to identify population declines and to develop conservation management. Because long-term monitoring is labour-intensive, resources to implement robust monitoring programmes are lacking in many countries. The increasing availability of citizen science data in online public databases can potentially fill gaps in structured monitoring programmes, but only if trends estimated from unstructured citizen science data match those estimated from structured monitoring programmes. We therefore aimed to assess the correlation between trends estimated from structured and unstructured data. Location Denmark. Methods We compared population trends for 103 bird species estimated over 28 years from a structured monitoring programme and from unstructured citizen science data to assess whether trends estimated from the two data sources were correlated. Results Trends estimated from the two data sources were generally positively correlated, but less than half the population declines identified from the structured monitoring data were recovered from the unstructured citizen science data. The mismatch persisted when we reduced the structured monitoring data from count data to occurrence data to mimic the information content of unstructured citizen science data and when we filtered the unstructured data to reduce the number of incomplete lists reported. Mismatching trends were especially prevalent for the most common species. Worryingly, more than half the species showing significant declines in the structured monitoring showed significant positive trends in the citizen science data. Main conclusions We caution that unstructured citizen science databases cannot replace structured monitoring data because the former are less sensitive to population changes. Thus, unstructured data may not fulfil one of the most critical functions of structured monitoring programmes, namely to act as an early warning system that detects population declines.

In this sense, we offer a characterization of citizen science and show how the participation of non-specialists can contribute to epistemic strengthening through plurality. Furthermore, we examine how the inclusion of members of society in scientific research can foster epistemic improvement of individuals, by promoting critical thinking. We conclude by pointing out the fact that citizen science can optimize these kinds of epistemic improvement by designing projects that, in addition to their scientific objectives, are aimed at attaining these goods.

Design/methodology/approach The authors review trends in Arctic expedition cruise tourism and current needs in Arctic research and monitoring, and clarify where the expedition cruise tourism industry could have the most impact by providing data to the scientific community. The authors also compare the regulatory context in the Antarctic to that in the Arctic and discuss how these differences could affect the widespread use of citizen science. At last, the authors describe some general principles for designing citizen science programs to be successful on board, and highlight several existing programs that are being recognized for their contributions to a greater scientific understanding of the Arctic. Findings The authors find that citizen science data from the expedition cruise industry are underutilized as a tool for monitoring Arctic change. Numerous examples illustrate how citizen science programs on-board expedition ships can successfully collect robust scientific data and contribute to enhancing the knowledge and stewardship capacity of cruise passengers. Inclusion of citizen science data from the expedition cruise industry should be considered a critical part of international Arctic observing networks and systems. Social implications Active participation in Arctic citizen science by tourists on expedition cruise ships has many potential benefits beyond the collection of high quality data, from increasing passengers' knowledge and understanding of the Arctic while on board, to affecting their attitudes and behaviors after they return home. Originality/value The potential for tourism to contribute to Arctic observing systems has been discussed previously in the scientific literature; the authors narrow the focus to citizen science programs in the expedition cruise industry, and provide concrete examples, in the hope that this will streamline acceptance and implementation of these ideas by researchers and tourism practitioners.
